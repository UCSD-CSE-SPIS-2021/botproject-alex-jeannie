- scraped discord messages to make a training dataset
- scraper: https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter/
- message source: Aerin Chu, who kindly gave permission for us to use her messages
- pasted basic markovify program
comments:
  - make sure program can detect the end of a sentence/phrase; people don't usually fully punctuate discord messages
  - denote end of sentence/phrase?? when do people split up their messages
  - unconventional language: misspelled words ("heyyyyy"), emojis (":3"), keysmashes ("sdfjsk")
  - sentiment analysis?

- cleaned aerin1.txt --> aerin1cleaned1.txt
- ran through markovify
- modified default call so that markovify delineates new lines as "sentences" rather than looking for punctuation

comments:
  - need to consider what the bot is responding to!
  - use markovify.NewlineText to delineate new segment of text?* done
