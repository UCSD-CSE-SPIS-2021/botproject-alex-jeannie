Create bot on discord- there is a setting for that.
Discord has a specific API and terminology (guild is equal to server)
import discord.py in order to gain access to discord bot specific functions (import discord?)
Create an instance of client inside the source code to track state and handle the connection to discord 
client.event allows for the bot to respond to events
on_message() allows for the bot to respond specifically to new messages
