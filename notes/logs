- scraped discord messages to make a training dataset
- scraper: https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter/
- message source: Aerin Chu, who kindly gave permission for us to use her messages
- pasted basic markovify program
comments:
  - make sure program can detect the end of a sentence/phrase; people don't usually fully punctuate discord messages
  - denote end of sentence/phrase?? when do people split up their messages
  - unconventional language: misspelled words ("heyyyyy"), emojis (":3"), keysmashes ("sdfjsk")
  - sentiment analysis? 


8/27/2021
- cleaned aerin1.txt --> aerin1cleaned1.txt (data preprocessing)
- ran through markovify
- modified default call so that markovify delineates new lines as "sentences" rather than looking for punctuation

comments:
  - need to consider what the bot is responding to! how??
  - use markovify.NewlineText to delineate new segment of text?* done
  - ideas:
    - make it so bot can also return wordclouds? word frequencies, etc.
    - live scraping? make it so it updates every time
    - mood? sentiment analysis?
  - ask josh for discord bot help!!
  Niema: 
  - state_size is order of markov chain (how many previous words the generated word depends on)
  - for live scraping: update chain, retrain
  - classify types of messages? for replies -- jokes, positive/negative (sentiment analysis)

8/28/2021
- intent classification
  - ex. greetings, identity
- scraping messages + replies
- after scraping, use markov chain to generate different answers for certain questions
- NLU (natural language understanding) datasets, machine learning datasets, NLP datasets
- movie script datasets
- python chatbot library

Goals list:
- Bare minimum - discord bot that generates aerinlike sentences
  - how do we make it more realistic?
- "good to have" goal - discord bot that can respond to text
  - classifies text (sentiment/mood and type of response), message it's responding to
- stretch goal - discord bot retrains itself live given a response 

Steps?
1. make a markov generator + train it on aerin's texts (DONE)
2. classify intent of these texts
3. scrape data + classify intent of messages it could respond to (the messages aerin was responding to)
(unclear zone)

?. discord bot basics, coding, how to implement this code into discord, how to get inputs, how to scrape live messages

back to 8/28/21:
  to do:
  - overall: create a working chatbot!
  - import chatterbot
  - scrape data!
