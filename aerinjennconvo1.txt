i honestly find essays and english the easiest of all classes
i used to love timed essays


[07-Aug-21 02:57 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
i did that too on my old school account but that’s deleted now agh i should’ve changed it


[07-Aug-21 02:57 AM] king of cats#9205
and i think my teacher hated me for loving timed essays


[07-Aug-21 02:57 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
i don’t agree with you uhhh do you wanna take mmw for me LMAO


[07-Aug-21 02:57 AM] king of cats#9205
well he didn't actually hate me
i was one of his favorite students
but i would write a ton of pages of stuff
it was usually pretty thick when i was finally done


[07-Aug-21 02:58 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
ok i used to like them bc my take home essays were basically timed because i would procrastinate soo much and they’d be the same quality

[07-Aug-21 02:58 AM] king of cats#9205
yeahh
imagine how the person grading my whap test felt
they probably felt like they got slapped with a giant tidal wave of words

[07-Aug-21 02:58 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
maybe they saw the stack and just gave it a good grade :D
reminds me of how ppl would say to just ramble on act essay and you’d do well


[07-Aug-21 02:59 AM] king of cats#9205
i'm just really quick to make things up
oml that act essay is so easy
so was the sat essay
except that one time where i got a low score for arguing against the prompt
but we don't talk about that


[07-Aug-21 02:59 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
i did better on the act one for both parts lol
sad moment when i remmeber that they did nothing for my admissions
LOL


[07-Aug-21 02:59 AM] king of cats#9205
i thought the essay was the easiest part of the standardized test
i was so bad with math
i really got a 27 on math
even though i did calc ab


[07-Aug-21 03:00 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
i definitely didn’t like the essay
ripp sometimes it’s easier without the higher level knowledge tho because i think it only went to geo or alg


[07-Aug-21 03:00 AM] king of cats#9205
honestly that is so fair
ngl i did terrible in precalc/trig as in i understood almost nothing
and i still did just fine in calculus ab
i left with an a

[07-Aug-21 03:01 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
reminds me of how i tried tot tutor a 6th grader in a class i never took bc i skipped it... they were learning smth SO USELESS i didn’t know how to do it aidkskckdkcd

[07-Aug-21 03:01 AM] king of cats#9205
then a semester later i had to drop calc bc because it was like gibberish to me

[07-Aug-21 03:02 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
hmm i did rly well in precalc but bc was much more difficult but i did well bc the ap test was online and there wasn’t mcq lmao

[07-Aug-21 03:02 AM] king of cats#9205
i was lucky my professor took out the part of the final on integrals since everyone bombed that part


[07-Aug-21 03:02 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
PRE CALC

[07-Aug-21 03:02 AM] king of cats#9205
ahahah


[07-Aug-21 03:02 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
my phone hates me
i forgot how it even works


[07-Aug-21 03:02 AM] king of cats#9205
i only like derivatives
and my stats class was wayyyyyy better


[07-Aug-21 03:02 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
derivatives are easier and you don’t have to +c it


[07-Aug-21 03:03 AM] king of cats#9205
i just got to use my calculator and not show most of my work


[07-Aug-21 03:03 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
lol stats annoyed me there was too much writing

[07-Aug-21 03:03 AM] king of cats#9205
i literally took ab and bc back to back in semesters and still forgot integrals
so now i have to retake bc cause i dropped it


[07-Aug-21 03:04 AM] crossboy#7777
its okay you can take fewer courses whenever you have to take calc b (if you want to)!
you probably will have to do calc c as well but it's not as bad as calc b imo


[07-Aug-21 03:04 AM] king of cats#9205
lmao i have most of my ges done so i can't put it off much longer to begin with lmaoooo


[07-Aug-21 03:04 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
as of now i only need linear algebra but if i try to change something about my path then i might need to do 20c whatever that is and i don’t wanna have to relearn

[07-Aug-21 03:05 AM] king of cats#9205
oh that is going to be fun in the most painful way possible


[07-Aug-21 03:05 AM] crossboy#7777
doing multidimensional derivatives sounds terrible but it's not actually that bad


[07-Aug-21 03:05 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
for cogsci it isn’t required *i think*


[07-Aug-21 03:05 AM] crossboy#7777
it's literally just do the derivative twice
and that's pretty much the whole class
"do this thing you alreayd know how to do, but do it twice instead"


[07-Aug-21 03:05 AM] king of cats#9205
that is actually kinda nice


[07-Aug-21 03:06 AM] crossboy#7777
yah its definitely not as hard of a jump as b is lolol


[07-Aug-21 03:06 AM] king of cats#9205
b is not a jump
it's a shove off a cliff


[07-Aug-21 03:06 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
it doesn’t sound too bad now but idk you might just be very smart lolll
i don’t even know if calc bc also teaches a? never understood the system

[07-Aug-21 03:07 AM] king of cats#9205
it's fine though, i think my current existing college gpa can carry me even if i mess up two math classes


[07-Aug-21 03:07 AM] crossboy#7777
ya plus you might be able to take some stuff p/np as well (can't remember if math is able to be) so that's always an option


[07-Aug-21 03:07 AM] king of cats#9205
whenever i see p/np i think of that millenium problem


[07-Aug-21 03:08 AM] crossboy#7777
which problem?


[07-Aug-21 03:09 AM] king of cats#9205
it's one of those very difficult to solve math problems that has like a huge reward if you can get the correct solution


[07-Aug-21 03:09 AM] crossboy#7777
OH THAT P/NP


[07-Aug-21 03:09 AM] king of cats#9205
i want to say that one of them did get solved but i also might have remembered wrong


[07-Aug-21 03:09 AM] crossboy#7777
yeah it's a huge problem in math/cs, it might get covered in spis a bit but im not sure

[07-Aug-21 03:09 AM] king of cats#9205
i know they mentioned p/np but not the actual problem itself
i was watching gifted and the millenium problems came up
along with the trachtenberg method i think
i remember uselessly large words and then when i need to use them my brain goes b l a n k


[07-Aug-21 03:10 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
sounds like another last name


[07-Aug-21 03:10 AM] king of cats#9205
trachtenberg is a last name


[07-Aug-21 03:11 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
my brain forgets sooo many words it makes me so annoyed during timed essays because i can’t think about what that random common word is


[07-Aug-21 03:11 AM] king of cats#9205
i am usually that one student who is technically done but keeps writing anyway


[07-Aug-21 03:11 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
yeah all these equations  and methods named after people just confuse me
could never relate
i usually have half my paper written and it’s just unfinished

[07-Aug-21 03:12 AM] king of cats#9205
i know i have a large vocabulary
i just never use it
and i really like learning those random words from tumblr that are so rarely used
and then i don't use them


[07-Aug-21 03:13 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
i love that
i think i used to do that


[07-Aug-21 03:13 AM] king of cats#9205
the only time those tumblr words ever come into use is when yet another person titles a fanfic using one of those


[07-Aug-21 03:13 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
like defenestrate
i’m surprised i actually remembered one of the strange words i learned


[07-Aug-21 03:13 AM] king of cats#9205
i learned words like gracile
which i never use
and then i randomly apply chemistry terminology to real life
despite sleeping through my chemistry honors class during my second semester


[07-Aug-21 03:14 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
doesn’t even sound english tbh


[07-Aug-21 03:14 AM] king of cats#9205
i still don't know how i got an a in that class


[07-Aug-21 03:14 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
lolll i like randomly throwing in chem bc that class actually interested me


[07-Aug-21 03:14 AM] king of cats#9205
and my chem 1a was carried by huge extra credit
i overuse state function
not in the literal sense
but i just use it to mean like the process isn't important, just the destination
i think i've also equated people to the different elemental groups before


[07-Aug-21 03:15 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
oh lmaoo i was thinking boit it
wow


[07-Aug-21 03:15 AM] king of cats#9205
and people always look at me funny for it


[07-Aug-21 03:15 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
i would probably tbh LOL


[07-Aug-21 03:15 AM] king of cats#9205
not that i find it important how they feel lmfao


[07-Aug-21 03:15 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
you just seem like a metalloid today


[07-Aug-21 03:16 AM] king of cats#9205
i'll just be like "noble gas personality type" out of the blue
or i'll say someone's like a halogen


[07-Aug-21 03:16 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
oh wait groups not properties see i forogt most my chem oops
wait i could see the noble gas tho


[07-Aug-21 03:16 AM] king of cats#9205
i think the weirdest thing i've ever done was try to convert all my writing into old english runes


[07-Aug-21 03:17 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
maybe even alkaline earth it’s strange
oh i really can’t deal w old english


[07-Aug-21 03:17 AM] king of cats#9205
old english and old english runes are different
the runes looked a lot like dwarvish from lotr
and i thought they were pretty


[07-Aug-21 03:17 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
OH


[07-Aug-21 03:17 AM] king of cats#9205
yeah


[07-Aug-21 03:17 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
i just searched it ok


[07-Aug-21 03:18 AM] king of cats#9205
i mean before that i wanted to write mirror script but being left handed, i technically could have done that to start


[07-Aug-21 03:18 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
gives me hieroglyph vibes


[07-Aug-21 03:18 AM] king of cats#9205
yeah it really does
there's also elvish which is pretty
i also at one point wanted to be ambidextrous


[07-Aug-21 03:18 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
have you practiced mirror script at all?


[07-Aug-21 03:18 AM] king of cats#9205
so i can kinda write with my right hand


[07-Aug-21 03:18 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
oo elvish looks mystical


[07-Aug-21 03:18 AM] king of cats#9205
i mean i usually don't but i can do it alright


[07-Aug-21 03:19 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
ahahah i used to practice my left


[07-Aug-21 03:19 AM] king of cats#9205
i can read mirrored text just fine
i can technically draw with my right hand using a mouse


[07-Aug-21 03:19 AM] king of cats#9205
but not with a pencil


[07-Aug-21 03:19 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
there were a few stages where i literally would use my left in school but then i started to need to write fast and that didn’t work


[07-Aug-21 03:19 AM] king of cats#9205
not that well
ahahah when i write fast i end up with print-cursive


[07-Aug-21 03:20 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
i’ve never tried because i just can’t draw at all with anything LOL


[07-Aug-21 03:20 AM] king of cats#9205
the only thing i can consistently draw are cats
and sometimes bears


[07-Aug-21 03:20 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
my handwriting is pretty bad it looks scribbly because i end up connecting everythibg
i need to learn how to draw cute animals


[07-Aug-21 03:20 AM] king of cats#9205
i learned cursive and now i mix my print and cursive


[07-Aug-21 03:20 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
like just stick figure version


[07-Aug-21 03:20 AM] king of cats#9205
it looks confusing as heck though reading my notes
usually when i write words that end in ing, the i disappears
it just leaves


[07-Aug-21 03:21 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
i guess some of my writing is cursive because of how it connects but i usually don’t write things like the cursive s anymore


[07-Aug-21 03:21 AM] king of cats#9205
i also don't dot my i's anymore sooooooooo
my i's and e's look similar


[07-Aug-21 03:21 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
i haven’t written in so long i can’t remmeber how i write
many times when i write my names i don’t write 2 n’s properly


[07-Aug-21 03:22 AM] king of cats#9205
ahahahah i write things down by hand


[07-Aug-21 03:22 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
i just have some lumpy scribbled


[07-Aug-21 03:22 AM] king of cats#9205
i tend to forget otherwise


[07-Aug-21 03:22 AM] king of cats#9205
cause if i type i sometimes i forget to check where i left whatever i wrote down


[07-Aug-21 03:22 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
ah i like typing bc i’ll forget anyways LOL


[07-Aug-21 03:22 AM] king of cats#9205
honestly i just realized
i'm kinda like a function


[07-Aug-21 03:22 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
oh i guess sometimes it doesn’t motivate me to read notes as much but
hmm


[07-Aug-21 03:22 AM] king of cats#9205
i just take in input, create an output
and then i forget everything again


[07-Aug-21 03:23 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
LOL


[07-Aug-21 03:23 AM] king of cats#9205
it actually explains why i have no clue what i've turned in for the most part
especially my essays, thank goodness no one asks me to explain those


[07-Aug-21 03:23 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
Won’t comment on that bc i don’t wanna say some strange incorrect code thing in a cs server 😩


[07-Aug-21 03:23 AM] king of cats#9205
ahahah i made my brother so frustrated
he was trying to help me check my code and then he was like wth



[07-Aug-21 03:23 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
o m g do you just turn in assignments or tests and completely forget the topic or prompt


[07-Aug-21 03:24 AM] king of cats#9205
oh i don't even really remember the prompt after i write it


[07-Aug-21 03:24 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
i tried to ask my sis but i forgot she knows nothing 😭


[07-Aug-21 03:24 AM] king of cats#9205
ahahah


[07-Aug-21 03:24 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
ikr people ask what i wrote about and i’m like ... what did we even do


[07-Aug-21 03:24 AM] king of cats#9205
i literally just try to think of the easiest way to solve the problem so i can write almost zero code 
i mean i just make something up, if i get a hint of what i should say, i can usually make something up. 
guess the theatre classes i took panned out years ago


[07-Aug-21 03:25 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
i wanna write less but my brain doenst process til after i do smth rly convoluted lmao


[07-Aug-21 03:25 AM] king of cats#9205
ahhhhhh same
i usually say something and then i end up overexplaining myself


[07-Aug-21 03:26 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
oo theater fun fun those classes scare me tho


[07-Aug-21 03:26 AM] king of cats#9205
they give me so much anxiety
but i also did them ig


[07-Aug-21 03:26 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
that’s me 50% of the time if i do speak i’ll overspeak


[07-Aug-21 03:26 AM] king of cats#9205
technically i guess i can act, i'm good with expressions


[07-Aug-21 03:26 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
but a lot of times i just don’t speak at all lol


[07-Aug-21 03:26 AM] king of cats#9205
ahahah when we had to do closing circle i really wrote out what i was going to say i still panicked anyway ahahah


[07-Aug-21 03:27 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
oo i just know i did one acting thing as a child and i laugh sm when i watch now and wonder what the heck happened to me


[07-Aug-21 03:27 AM] king of cats#9205
i used to do musicals so theoretically i should be okay with like idk stages?
but i'm not


[07-Aug-21 03:27 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
oh i didn’t get to go today :( how was it? forogt to ask someone about it


[07-Aug-21 03:27 AM] king of cats#9205
it took a long time and everyone just kinda thanked other people


[07-Aug-21 03:28 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
i used to have the worst stage fright (probably still do)


[07-Aug-21 03:28 AM] king of cats#9205
and i just read whatever i wrote while panicking oh i have stage fright too


[07-Aug-21 03:28 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
aw that’s nice i would probably not wanna speak up tho lmao


[07-Aug-21 03:28 AM] king of cats#9205
the deer in the headlights oh it was mandatory for everyone


[07-Aug-21 03:28 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
oh well
guess i’ll experience it next week=
ajejdkskckdkck


[07-Aug-21 03:29 AM] king of cats#9205
i swear things were easier when we were kids like being on stage and stuff i don't know how i did it then


[07-Aug-21 03:29 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
everything was easier then


[07-Aug-21 03:29 AM] king of cats#9205
it really wassss


[07-Aug-21 03:29 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
i really wanna channel my younger energy but i cannot comprehend


[07-Aug-21 03:29 AM] king of cats#9205
honestly i was thinking back to the musicals i did and i just realized how weirdly sexist my fair lady was like there's this whole song when the english professor rants about women


[07-Aug-21 03:30 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
i don’t rly know musicals well but i guess many were made back in the day where it was normal to be misogynistic


[07-Aug-21 03:30 AM] king of cats#9205
trueeeee honestly i got into musicals because of my parents


[07-Aug-21 03:31 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
i think a few years ago i wanted to try to do a musical but obviously my stage fright completely killed that


[07-Aug-21 03:31 AM] king of cats#9205
awwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
i think the first musical i saw was les mis or phantom i didn't understand the lovely ladies thing until like years later


[07-Aug-21 03:31 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
oo do your parents watch a lot


[07-Aug-21 03:31 AM] king of cats#9205
no not really


[07-Aug-21 03:31 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
my first (and only i think) was phantom


[07-Aug-21 03:32 AM] king of cats#9205
my dad just had them and i was introduced to them early although i watched ghibli films long before that


[07-Aug-21 03:32 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
ah makes sense oh those are all cute throwbacks now


[07-Aug-21 03:32 AM] king of cats#9205
i think the last muscial i saw was carrie


[07-Aug-21 03:33 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
oh wait i saw hamilton last year but it was from home so idk if that counts lol


[07-Aug-21 03:33 AM] king of cats#9205
ohhh hamilton is fun 
i don't remember if i did but i was looking forward to the in the heights film


[07-Aug-21 03:33 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
i just know it was free on disney + for a bit and my sister had my friends account lmao


[07-Aug-21 03:34 AM] king of cats#9205
did you ever have a gymnastics phase?

[07-Aug-21 03:34 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
omg i did gymnastics in prek i think lmao

[07-Aug-21 03:34 AM] king of cats#9205
ahahah sameeeeeeeeeee
and then i stopped
but i really wanted to do a handstand, so i taught myself


[07-Aug-21 03:35 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
started dance around that time tho and that was what i stuck with but i did have a few phases throughout where i wanted to do gymnastics things


[07-Aug-21 03:35 AM] king of cats#9205
i swear everyone did back in those days
ahahah


[07-Aug-21 03:35 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
oh sound of music has nice songs at least the ones i know lol tho i still can’t handstand i’m WEAK


[07-Aug-21 03:35 AM] king of cats#9205
i did ballet i think idk i don''t remember i can still do it, but it's best when you're in a pool soo much easier


[07-Aug-21 03:36 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
i did ballet til 7th i think then technically did it in hs but not rly oh i’ve never tried in a pool i don’t like water tbh i can’t even breathe easily when i’m standing in a pool lolll


[07-Aug-21 03:36 AM] king of cats#9205
ohhh that actually makes sense you could also do it against a wall


[07-Aug-21 03:37 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
i can see how handstand would be easier but like id prob choke on water LOL i used to do that but my arms would give out too soon hehe


[07-Aug-21 03:37 AM] king of cats#9205
i honestly went through trial and error to do it but i also did basketball as a sport soooooooooo


[07-Aug-21 03:38 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
i guess i didn’t care much about handstands bc i wanted to be flexible and do tricks more lmao oh sports not my thing but tbh basketball was an ok unit in pe loll


[07-Aug-21 03:38 AM] king of cats#9205
i can't say if sports were really my thing


[07-Aug-21 03:38 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
tho i’ve barely scored any baskets in my life


[07-Aug-21 03:38 AM] king of cats#9205
i just did them i was only good at guarding


[07-Aug-21 03:39 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
dance was my only athletic thing ever til that one year of track ew yeah i can’t do that either but ehhh whatwver LOL


[07-Aug-21 03:39 AM] king of cats#9205
i just didn't like doing offensive stuff


[07-Aug-21 03:39 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
not gonna play bball in the future or anything


[07-Aug-21 03:40 AM] king of cats#9205
honestly if i actually focused on cross country, my stamina would probably be better smh i think by the end of the season was when my stamina was just beginning to get good and then the season ended ahahahah


[07-Aug-21 03:40 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
but that’s the hard part :’) idk how people have the motivation i wish i could


[07-Aug-21 03:40 AM] king of cats#9205
i don't even know how i convinced myself to run 2 miles


[07-Aug-21 03:40 AM] jennosaur♡#5678

and the worst part was i had a friend who was shouting at me to run faster ahahah


[07-Aug-21 03:41 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
1 is my max bc it’s required in pe smh


[07-Aug-21 03:41 AM] king of cats#9205
honestly 1 mile is so nice


[07-Aug-21 03:41 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
oh no that pressure when you’re alrd dying trying to pace yourself


[07-Aug-21 03:41 AM] king of cats#9205
pfft i would actually slow down just to spite him ahahah


[07-Aug-21 03:41 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
i disagree 1 lap is more than enough LOL i did sprints in t&f bc i wanted to hurdle

[07-Aug-21 03:42 AM] king of cats#9205
oml the 400 m as a track event is so hardddddddddd


[07-Aug-21 03:42 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
AGREED


[07-Aug-21 03:42 AM] king of cats#9205
i still remember doing training


[07-Aug-21 03:42 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
i literally never did it before but my first meet, they signed everyone up for the 400


[07-Aug-21 03:42 AM] king of cats#9205
i'd have to do those weird things where you sprint 50 m and walk 50 m or something and go up by increments of 50 or something


[07-Aug-21 03:42 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
i basically died


[07-Aug-21 03:42 AM] king of cats#9205
i ran a 3200 once


[07-Aug-21 03:42 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
ohh yeah i think we did that


[07-Aug-21 03:42 AM] king of cats#9205
it was horrid


[07-Aug-21 03:42 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
ewww disgusting n


[07-Aug-21 03:42 AM] king of cats#9205
i did pretty good in 400 and then i quit


[07-Aug-21 03:43 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
after the first meet i never did the 409 again even tho i was supposed to lmao i did horrendous in literally everything but jumps and hurdles


[07-Aug-21 03:43 AM] king of cats#9205
honestly lining up gives me anxiety i just get all freaked out being in line and stuff


[07-Aug-21 03:43 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
WHCIH WERE THE REASON I WANTD TO JOIN but didn’t think i’d need to just run for 95% of practice and the gun scared me lol i have slow reflexes too


[07-Aug-21 03:44 AM] king of cats#9205
oh yeah, track definitely is like RUN RUN RUN


[07-Aug-21 03:44 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
i joined with friends who also just wanted to do jumping events but they quit i forgot why


[07-Aug-21 03:44 AM] king of cats#9205
i used to just watch people get smoked


[07-Aug-21 03:44 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
and i was left there not realizing jumping is for sprinters who only run during practice and have to stay extra to do other stuff lmao


[07-Aug-21 03:44 AM] king of cats#9205
like one of the soccer players was in track and he would outsprint practically everyone in the 100m


[07-Aug-21 03:45 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
ok but it’s sometimes interesting to wat h fast ppl


[07-Aug-21 03:45 AM] king of cats#9205

[07-Aug-21 03:45 AM] jennosaur♡#5678

[07-Aug-21 03:45 AM] king of cats#9205
