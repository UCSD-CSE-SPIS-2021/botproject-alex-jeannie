[01-Aug-21 06:29 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
I recommend going to bed a bit earlier than you normally go to bed. If it's dark you might fall asleep!

early classes suck when they're in person because when it's morning during like winter, it's cold

Theyre a time to keep working on the labs with your partner, especially if you feel you didnt have as much time as you would have liked earlier! Theyre definitely encouraged (and you can hang out with the cool mentors who will be on duty)

[03-Aug-21 09:34 AM] Shirty#7768
the time youre given is basically the window during which you can enroll! earlier times are better since fewer classes will be full, but other factors (like priority for cs majors to get into cs classes) can also contribute to how likely it is youll get your courses. in general, i wouldnt stress too much about the very first quarter though--youll get better and better times as you gain sophomore/junior/senior standing, so one missed course now wont hold you back in the long run!

[03-Aug-21 12:35 PM] crossboy#7777
yeah and the first enrollment is fully random! later on you'll get priority based on how many units you've taken (aka if your'e a freshman, sophmore, etc) including transfer/AP courses!

i know a few people in our group thought that maybe doing a bit later in the session would have been better since it's only been a few days since we met everyone lmao


[04-Aug-21 05:08 PM] diegom1#3882

[06-Aug-21 11:03 PM] king of cats#9205
a lot of people were calling out the school for not doing anything like my friend knew this dude dating a middle schooler


[06-Aug-21 11:03 PM] alexavndra#4425
a MIDDLE SCHOOLERüòÄ


[06-Aug-21 11:03 PM] king of cats#9205
and then my school had plenty of evidence that me and like two other girls at the school dated an abusive creep who should not have been allowed back on campus


[06-Aug-21 11:03 PM] king of cats#9205
but funny thing was that when i reached out to the school and was like hi this guy is a danger to students at the school


[06-Aug-21 11:04 PM] alexavndra#4425
bro


[06-Aug-21 11:04 PM] king of cats#9205
they ignored the email and the person in charge of handling it yelled at the youngest person involved

[06-Aug-21 11:04 PM] king of cats#9205
said something like i should not have contacted them about the issue with the guy


[06-Aug-21 11:04 PM] king of cats#9205
and so i escalated it to the district and emailed the superintendent


[06-Aug-21 11:04 PM] king of cats#9205
caused a whole emergency meeting at my high school and then nothing happened


[06-Aug-21 11:05 PM] king of cats#9205

ugh props to you for having the courage to reach out but theyre literally making it so that people wont want to speak out about things like this


[06-Aug-21 11:05 PM] king of cats#9205
there were a bunch of complaints against other students as well that apparently the school did nothing about


[06-Aug-21 11:06 PM] king of cats#9205
the only time school actually did something was when there was a case on campus where they had a bunch of people who took videos or something on snapchat cause it was in the bathrooms at school


[06-Aug-21 11:06 PM] king of cats#9205
but idk it's a public school


[06-Aug-21 11:07 PM] Viridion#0234

the most recent picture of our school, and i'm not kidding, is literally from a mercury news article about our school having a jv soccer coach who dated a student


[06-Aug-21 11:08 PM] king of cats#9205
i think there's no reputation left


[06-Aug-21 11:08 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
literally most schools are like this and it's so damaging to students too


[06-Aug-21 11:08 PM] jive#5916
oh there was a dude at my school who got caught sending unsolicited "content" to literally like more than 100 girls, some of whom were literally in middle school


[06-Aug-21 11:08 PM] jive#5916
school did nothing


[06-Aug-21 11:08 PM] jive#5916
everybody just ignored him


[06-Aug-21 11:08 PM] Viridion#0234

[06-Aug-21 11:12 PM] king of cats#9205
i had proof the guy took inappropriate pictures of the freshman he had been dating and i‚Äôm pretty sure he kept them but ig school didn‚Äôt care but it‚Äôs illegal


[06-Aug-21 11:12 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678

[06-Aug-21 11:13 PM] king of cats#9205
every school everrrr

{Reactions}
Ew 

[06-Aug-21 11:13 PM] NewtonC#5434
school wouldn't "care" unless everyone already finds out, and even then they're just doing damage control


[06-Aug-21 11:13 PM] king of cats#9205
even my middle school did that


[06-Aug-21 11:14 PM] NewtonC#5434
or unless a parent gets involved ig


[06-Aug-21 11:14 PM] jive#5916
everything just comes down to pr


[06-Aug-21 11:14 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
mhm my school isnt as bad bc i went to a private school for middle/high but it still had so many questionable things


[06-Aug-21 11:14 PM] king of cats#9205
nah that thing with the superintendent apparently didn‚Äôt work even with a parent involved


[06-Aug-21 11:14 PM] NewtonC#5434
My school had a pedo coach who went to the swimming pool and took pictures of girls' backs and got caught by a parent, and then he got fired and arrested


[06-Aug-21 11:15 PM] king of cats#9205
i wonder when they're going to have bright idea to actually do something


[06-Aug-21 11:15 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
that‚Äôs so creepy i‚Äôm glad they didn‚Äôt ignore that but uhhh


[06-Aug-21 11:15 PM] NewtonC#5434
Bruh the superintendent is dumb


[06-Aug-21 11:15 PM] king of cats#9205
like i remember schools saying don't be a bystander and then they are though


[06-Aug-21 11:16 PM] Viridion#0234
lmao thats the same thing my pe pedo teacher did except he didnt get caught


[06-Aug-21 11:16 PM] Viridion#0234
oh wait, it was girls doing backstroke


[06-Aug-21 11:16 PM] king of cats#9205
it took an instagram page calling them out and publishing stories from people for the school to even address it and all they did was say that they were doing everything they could :p


[06-Aug-21 11:16 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh yeah the bullying and cliche reporting talks that they don‚Äôt follow


[06-Aug-21 11:16 PM] NewtonC#5434
They're worse than bystanders, I've never seen a bystander try to actively hide evidence and tamper with the case T_T


[06-Aug-21 11:16 PM] king of cats#9205
but they were more than happy to take someone off campus in cuffs for drug dealing apparently


[06-Aug-21 11:17 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
they just have wonky priorities


[06-Aug-21 11:17 PM] alexavndra#4425

[06-Aug-21 11:17 PM] king of cats#9205
y e s


[06-Aug-21 11:18 PM] king of cats#9205
and then they do that speech where they say something like "we're going to make the school better"


[06-Aug-21 11:18 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh yes every year


[06-Aug-21 11:18 PM] king of cats#9205
but they only meant the buildings


[06-Aug-21 11:18 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ü§°


[06-Aug-21 11:18 PM] NewtonC#5434
and by "we" they mean "funding from the government/school fundraising"


[06-Aug-21 11:19 PM] king of cats#9205
oml yeahhhhh


[06-Aug-21 11:19 PM] king of cats#9205
i swear schools are proud of the weirdest things


[06-Aug-21 11:19 PM] king of cats#9205
for example, why do they have a special trophy for the students with all as at the end of their high school career?


[06-Aug-21 11:20 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
they wanna emphasize how ‚Äúacademically excellent‚Äù they are of course! nothing else matters


[06-Aug-21 11:21 PM] king of cats#9205
omg yes and then they're like mEnTaL hEaLtH


[06-Aug-21 11:21 PM] king of cats#9205
but then they also have those counselors who you can't really be too sure about


[06-Aug-21 11:21 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
aHaHa teens are just too angsty they‚Äôre making it up of course!?!!‚Äôh


[06-Aug-21 11:22 PM] king of cats#9205

[06-Aug-21 11:22 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678

and then i do it anyway because idk


[06-Aug-21 11:56 PM] Uma#9769

[06-Aug-21 11:56 PM] king of cats#9205
a quiet chat always kinda bugs me


[06-Aug-21 11:56 PM] king of cats#9205
i blame the guild i joined in a game

[06-Aug-21 11:57 PM] king of cats#9205

[06-Aug-21 11:57 PM] Uma#9769
i think ive seen ads for that


[06-Aug-21 11:57 PM] king of cats#9205

all the sites have so many pop ups and adblock doesnt work üò≠


[07-Aug-21 12:09 AM] king of cats#9205
some scans teams also made their own sites after mangadex went down for maintenance


[07-Aug-21 12:09 AM] Uma#9769
i heard those two closed


[07-Aug-21 12:09 AM] king of cats#9205
mangadex is adless and bato.to has some i think


[07-Aug-21 12:09 AM] king of cats#9205
mangadex died for a few months but it's back and running


[07-Aug-21 12:09 AM] Uma#9769

[07-Aug-21 12:10 AM] king of cats#9205

[07-Aug-21 12:10 AM] king of cats#9205

[07-Aug-21 12:10 AM] Uma#9769
i used to read it more in the beginning of high school


[07-Aug-21 12:10 AM] king of cats#9205
i started reading cause i didn't have time to watch lmao


[07-Aug-21 12:11 AM] king of cats#9205
i always end up reading wayy too much so then when people ask, i have a ton of recs


[07-Aug-21 12:11 AM] Uma#9769
i think thats a good thing though


[07-Aug-21 12:11 AM] king of cats#9205
lmaooooo


[07-Aug-21 12:11 AM] Uma#9769
i always start a lot but dont finish any


[07-Aug-21 12:11 AM] king of cats#9205
i do the same thing with stuff on ao3


[07-Aug-21 12:11 AM] Uma#9769
and then i cant tell people if theyre good or not


[07-Aug-21 12:12 AM] king of cats#9205
lmaoooo a lot of what i read is in progress


[07-Aug-21 12:12 AM] king of cats#9205
but honestly it could be a good thing you don't finish


[07-Aug-21 12:12 AM] king of cats#9205
sometimes you get so invested that you forget to do everything else


[07-Aug-21 12:12 AM] Uma#9769
thats trueeee


[07-Aug-21 12:12 AM] Uma#9769
its distracting


[07-Aug-21 12:12 AM] king of cats#9205
there were a couple times where i stayed up wayyy too late reading


[07-Aug-21 12:12 AM] Uma#9769
i hate it when youre waiting for the next chapter


[07-Aug-21 12:12 AM] Uma#9769
sameee


[07-Aug-21 12:13 AM] king of cats#9205
but it's also so bad when you're 100 chapters behind or something


[07-Aug-21 12:13 AM] Uma#9769
then it feels overwhelming


[07-Aug-21 12:13 AM] king of cats#9205
i was around 200 chapters behind, if not more on tower of god


[07-Aug-21 12:13 AM] king of cats#9205
and i wasted like three days reading it all


[07-Aug-21 12:14 AM] Uma#9769
im so behind on tower of god


[07-Aug-21 12:14 AM] king of cats#9205
and then i stopped reading months later

[07-Aug-21 12:30 AM] Uma#9769
i didnt know that was a thing


[07-Aug-21 12:31 AM] king of cats#9205
it was our mutual classmate's fault


[07-Aug-21 12:31 AM] king of cats#9205
my friend gave him money to buy some trader joe's cold brew for them and then the guy went and bought two giant bottles of the concentrated type


[07-Aug-21 12:31 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
OH

[07-Aug-21 12:32 AM] ferreti#0348
it's so bitter


[07-Aug-21 12:33 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i used to say black coffee was better but i literally only drank it in elem/middle school


[07-Aug-21 12:33 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
now i just stay away


[07-Aug-21 12:33 AM] king of cats#9205
i think the only time i've heard of someone having black coffee that seemed feasible was affogato


[07-Aug-21 12:33 AM] king of cats#9205
wait elementary/middle school?


[07-Aug-21 12:33 AM] Uma#9769
yeah i used to drink it in middle school


[07-Aug-21 12:33 AM] king of cats#9205
my parents wouldn't let me touch that stuff


[07-Aug-21 12:33 AM] Uma#9769
because i was always sleepy


[07-Aug-21 12:33 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i had to search that but it looks good :o


[07-Aug-21 12:33 AM] king of cats#9205
they said it would make me short
but i'm 5'3


[07-Aug-21 12:34 AM] Uma#9769
i think it made me short


[07-Aug-21 12:34 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
im shorter üò≠


[07-Aug-21 12:34 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
yeah i blame it on the coffee


[07-Aug-21 12:34 AM] king of cats#9205
although they say that's also my disordered eating & messed up sleep schedule


[07-Aug-21 12:34 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i barely drank it but still


[07-Aug-21 12:34 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ah yeah that too!


[07-Aug-21 12:34 AM] Uma#9769
i think its also because i went vegan in middle school LMAO


[07-Aug-21 12:34 AM] king of cats#9205
my brother had coffee when he was a child


[07-Aug-21 12:34 AM] king of cats#9205
and he's taller than me


[07-Aug-21 12:34 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
sad moment


[07-Aug-21 12:34 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
and i could never go vegan


[07-Aug-21 12:35 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678

[07-Aug-21 12:35 AM] Uma#9769
i lasted 6 months


[07-Aug-21 12:35 AM] Uma#9769
then i gave up


[07-Aug-21 12:35 AM] king of cats#9205
i remember going to some chinese school on saturdays


[07-Aug-21 12:35 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i did that too


[07-Aug-21 12:35 AM] king of cats#9205
and every year they'd try to convince us kids to go vegetarian


[07-Aug-21 12:35 AM] king of cats#9205
cause they were buddhist


[07-Aug-21 12:35 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh interesting i wonder if it worked on people


[07-Aug-21 12:35 AM] king of cats#9205

[07-Aug-21 12:37 AM] king of cats#9205
but i used to cause so much trouble there


[07-Aug-21 12:37 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678

[07-Aug-21 12:37 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678

[07-Aug-21 12:37 AM] king of cats#9205
yessssssss


[07-Aug-21 12:37 AM] king of cats#9205
so now i'm almost illiterate in chinese ahahahahah


[07-Aug-21 12:38 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
yeah my parents were so disapponted when i did chinese 1 freshman year LOLL


[07-Aug-21 12:38 AM] king of cats#9205
i use google translate so i can read


[07-Aug-21 12:38 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i started from 1 so i did ap last year and i got into chinese entertainment so now my mandarin is slightly ok but i cant read or write anyways


[07-Aug-21 12:38 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
me too!!


[07-Aug-21 12:38 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i can read pinyin and usually understand it well enough


[07-Aug-21 12:38 AM] king of cats#9205
i can't understand pinyin sometimes


[07-Aug-21 12:38 AM] king of cats#9205
but i can understand old people talking cause my relatives talk in chinese all the time


[07-Aug-21 12:39 AM] king of cats#9205
although i probably understand more taiwanese over chinese


[07-Aug-21 12:39 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ah i only know casual lingo not the fancy stuff


[07-Aug-21 12:39 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
omg really i wanna learn taiwanese but idk how... my parents used to just speak it so my sis and i wouldnt understand


[07-Aug-21 12:39 AM] king of cats#9205
most of my older relatives speak it


[07-Aug-21 12:40 AM] king of cats#9205
so i picked it up pretty fast cause i was pretty much the only child among the elderly


[07-Aug-21 12:40 AM] king of cats#9205

[07-Aug-21 12:40 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678

but usually i don't and i'm apparently not supposed to


[07-Aug-21 12:41 AM] king of cats#9205
mainly cause my cousins on my mom's side don't speak it ig?


[07-Aug-21 12:41 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ahh that would make sense but its still so cool


[07-Aug-21 12:41 AM] king of cats#9205
so it's just weird if i'm speaking taiwanese or using taiwanese phrases when they don't


[07-Aug-21 12:41 AM] king of cats#9205
not that i don't


[07-Aug-21 12:42 AM] king of cats#9205
i used to mix taiwanese and chinese soooooo much


[07-Aug-21 12:42 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678

[07-Aug-21 12:42 AM] king of cats#9205

[07-Aug-21 12:42 AM] king of cats#9205

[07-Aug-21 12:44 AM] king of cats#9205

[07-Aug-21 12:45 AM] ferreti#0348
can we pretend that airplanes ‚úàÔ∏è  in the night sky üå†  are like sharks ü¶à  killed by country music üé∏


[07-Aug-21 12:45 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i used to be perma dnd but now i just mute the tab so sometimes during lab hrs im like... i cant hear anything...


[07-Aug-21 12:45 AM] king of cats#9205
there was this one dude in my class who would talk and there would be just the sound of discord notifs


[07-Aug-21 12:45 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
interesting lyrics


[07-Aug-21 12:45 AM] ferreti#0348

[07-Aug-21 12:45 AM] Viridion#0234
girlboss grindset never stops


[07-Aug-21 12:45 AM] Uma#9769

[07-Aug-21 12:45 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
people didnt care anymore


[07-Aug-21 12:45 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
yall take your cult away


[07-Aug-21 12:45 AM] king of cats#9205
ironically the notifs were messages from people telling him to turn on dnd


[07-Aug-21 12:45 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
LMAO


[07-Aug-21 12:46 AM] king of cats#9205
i swear no one paid any attention in class


[07-Aug-21 12:46 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ok some people would do that and there are those bold ones that unmute before answering a question and you just hear them googling it frantically


[07-Aug-21 12:46 AM] king of cats#9205
i did absolutely nothing in most of my classes


[07-Aug-21 12:46 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
same same


[07-Aug-21 12:46 AM] ferreti#0348
this is HILARIOUS


[07-Aug-21 12:46 AM] king of cats#9205
i didn't even read some of my required reading


[07-Aug-21 12:46 AM] Uma#9769
yeah senior year was rough


[07-Aug-21 12:46 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
im actually annoyed that i did better on ap tests this year bc theye basically didnt matter


[07-Aug-21 12:46 AM] king of cats#9205
my econ/us history was like free period


[07-Aug-21 12:47 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh i didnt read a single book


[07-Aug-21 12:47 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oops


[07-Aug-21 12:47 AM] king of cats#9205
i was supposed to read dracula, couldn't  get interested


[07-Aug-21 12:47 AM] king of cats#9205
and pretty much only used the book for quotes


[07-Aug-21 12:47 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
it became such a norm in my physics class and our teacher was so oblivious


[07-Aug-21 12:47 AM] king of cats#9205
my professors & teachers never really called on people


[07-Aug-21 12:48 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ok our lit class read king lear OUT LOUD during class for 2 weeks straight and i couldnt even name a single thing that happened because i would read the assigned parts brainlessly


[07-Aug-21 12:48 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
hmmm strange


[07-Aug-21 12:48 AM] king of cats#9205
i didn't have to read any shakespeare besides hamlet


[07-Aug-21 12:48 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
thats a classic ive never read it before tho


[07-Aug-21 12:48 AM] king of cats#9205
the rest of my year was short stories


[07-Aug-21 12:49 AM] king of cats#9205
i honestly made things up for practically every essay i had


[07-Aug-21 12:49 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
that seems more fun, we had so many poems and stuff and i really cannot analyze them


[07-Aug-21 12:49 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
me too i did pretty badly on a lot of my essays but somehow did ok on the ap test *apparently*


[07-Aug-21 12:49 AM] king of cats#9205
i used to have to write art analysis critiques in my art class at high school so i got used to making things up


[07-Aug-21 12:49 AM] king of cats#9205
my english 1b professor really thought i had reading comprehension issues


[07-Aug-21 12:49 AM] king of cats#9205
but i didn't actually read dracula and therefore had no idea what happened in the plot


[07-Aug-21 12:50 AM] king of cats#9205
but since she explained what happened, i wrote an essay that she thought was perfect


[07-Aug-21 12:50 AM] king of cats#9205
it was that bad


[07-Aug-21 12:50 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
thats a good skill


[07-Aug-21 12:50 AM] king of cats#9205
so now my brain is just mush


[07-Aug-21 12:50 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i was only good at that a few years ago but im pretty sure i got worse or teachers got harder to trick :((


[07-Aug-21 12:51 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i actually hope i dont go insane when in person school starts


[07-Aug-21 12:51 AM] king of cats#9205
i honestly don't know how i do it, but i have yet to encounter a teacher who finds my writing abilities bad
math however....


[07-Aug-21 12:51 AM] king of cats#9205
oml sameeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee


[07-Aug-21 12:51 AM] king of cats#9205
i feel like i'm just going to be losing my mind when school starts


[07-Aug-21 12:51 AM] king of cats#9205
i only just got used to socializing again


[07-Aug-21 12:52 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
lol my 1-th grade teacher hated my writign and i was offended til i realized that all my earlier teachers only cared about grammar/spelling and not content


[07-Aug-21 12:52 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
me too


[07-Aug-21 12:52 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i cannot socialize in person for my life tho


[07-Aug-21 12:52 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678

[07-Aug-21 12:52 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678

[07-Aug-21 12:52 AM] king of cats#9205

[07-Aug-21 12:52 AM] king of cats#9205

[07-Aug-21 12:56 AM] Uma#9769
yeah since it overlaps


[07-Aug-21 12:56 AM] king of cats#9205
i think all i really have left are upper division courses and like the cogsci specific ones


[07-Aug-21 12:56 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
yeah and cs is very competitive lol


[07-Aug-21 12:56 AM] king of cats#9205
i think i'm sophomore standing? idr


[07-Aug-21 12:56 AM] Uma#9769
are there more cs classes in upper division


[07-Aug-21 12:56 AM] king of cats#9205
yeah


[07-Aug-21 12:56 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
im technically sophomore standing but most my ap scores dont do anything for grad


[07-Aug-21 12:57 AM] Uma#9769
because i was looking at the plans thing and there were almost none in lower division


[07-Aug-21 12:57 AM] king of cats#9205
i have 90 units so i have like 90 left


[07-Aug-21 12:57 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh wow


[07-Aug-21 12:57 AM] Viridion#0234

[07-Aug-21 12:57 AM] Viridion#0234

[07-Aug-21 12:57 AM] king of cats#9205
yeah i did middle college for 11th & 12th


[07-Aug-21 12:57 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
you could double major in 3 years i you wanted i swear


[07-Aug-21 12:57 AM] king of cats#9205
nah


[07-Aug-21 12:57 AM] king of cats#9205
my brain would fry itself


[07-Aug-21 12:57 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
yeah def dont overwork yourself


[07-Aug-21 12:57 AM] king of cats#9205
i might take a minor though


[07-Aug-21 12:58 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
gosh that sounds like a lot to pile on for these 2 years tho


[07-Aug-21 12:58 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh yeah you know how the plan says dsgn 1 or cogs 10 for first quarter? i didnt even see those courses on the website for this quarter so idk if im going crazy


[07-Aug-21 12:58 AM] king of cats#9205
i had a few classmates who completed an aa


[07-Aug-21 12:58 AM] Uma#9769
i want to take cogs 1


[07-Aug-21 12:58 AM] king of cats#9205
yeah it's one or the other


[07-Aug-21 12:59 AM] king of cats#9205
i haven't checked course catalog yet, though i should


[07-Aug-21 12:59 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh i literally dont know anyone who did middle college so im not sure how it works


[07-Aug-21 12:59 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i thought it recommended cogs 1 for second quarter but im not sure why...


[07-Aug-21 12:59 AM] king of cats#9205
its like being a full time community college student and a full time high school student


[07-Aug-21 01:00 AM] king of cats#9205
might be because it's only offered then


[07-Aug-21 01:00 AM] king of cats#9205
some classes are like that


[07-Aug-21 01:00 AM] Uma#9769
its in fall quarter though so im not sure


[07-Aug-21 01:00 AM] Uma#9769
it could also be in winter


[07-Aug-21 01:00 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
yeah it was strange the one i thought i could take didnt seem like it was offered


[07-Aug-21 01:00 AM] king of cats#9205
well i think you can swap it out unless i'm wrong


[07-Aug-21 01:00 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ack 2 full times at a time seems so hard


[07-Aug-21 01:00 AM] king of cats#9205
but those are all considered ge


[07-Aug-21 01:00 AM] king of cats#9205
it actually wasn't


[07-Aug-21 01:00 AM] king of cats#9205
i had 2 high school classes and 3 college classes


[07-Aug-21 01:01 AM] king of cats#9205
i also took like 3 classes at another community college


[07-Aug-21 01:01 AM] king of cats#9205
my classmates who did aas took classes at the community college we all attended and did more at deanza or something to get their aa


[07-Aug-21 01:01 AM] king of cats#9205
so they're junior standing


[07-Aug-21 01:01 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh only 2 hs classes? idk why i thought youd need like 6-5 hs classes + more cc ones


[07-Aug-21 01:01 AM] king of cats#9205
lmaooooo nahhh that would be wayy too crazy


[07-Aug-21 01:01 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678

[07-Aug-21 01:02 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678

[07-Aug-21 01:12 AM] king of cats#9205

[07-Aug-21 01:26 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
my mom has made "boba" out of taro and otherboba things and you cant rly taste it so its alright


[07-Aug-21 01:27 AM] king of cats#9205
i usually end up starting a bunch of conversations in a different server i'm in


[07-Aug-21 01:27 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
maybe! or epopel will realize that this chat isnt dead and talk


[07-Aug-21 01:27 AM] king of cats#9205
Y E S i hope for that


[07-Aug-21 01:27 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
its always weirder if its not normally too active and you try to start it


[07-Aug-21 01:27 AM] king of cats#9205

[07-Aug-21 01:27 AM] king of cats#9205

[07-Aug-21 01:28 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i think there was only one server i used to be active in but then strange "drama" happend and thats why im always invis now LOL


[07-Aug-21 01:28 AM] king of cats#9205
i had a lot of practice from the other server since it's a guild server for a game where i have an activity req


[07-Aug-21 01:28 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
to think i used to start convos somehow-


[07-Aug-21 01:28 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ahh make ssense


[07-Aug-21 01:28 AM] king of cats#9205
i know some of the massive servers have really active chats


[07-Aug-21 01:28 AM] king of cats#9205
but i can't handle those cause you only meet people for what, five minutes?


[07-Aug-21 01:28 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
with those, i feel like you just pop in a bit and never go back again


[07-Aug-21 01:28 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
or its a complete other group


[07-Aug-21 01:29 AM] king of cats#9205
yep!!!!!


[07-Aug-21 01:29 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i definitely wouldnt remember people oops


[07-Aug-21 01:29 AM] king of cats#9205
although the kny server i'm in had a hilarious shrine for a once extremely active member of their server


[07-Aug-21 01:29 AM] king of cats#9205
and the funniest part was that the guy's username was inosuke


[07-Aug-21 01:29 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
omg i remember once i was kinda active on a sub only channel thing but i lost the sub and forgot everyone i talked to so those were sad hours


[07-Aug-21 01:29 AM] king of cats#9205
so for a while i thought they worshipped inosuke


[07-Aug-21 01:29 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
idk anime references üò≠


[07-Aug-21 01:29 AM] king of cats#9205
awwwwwwwwwwww that's sadddd


[07-Aug-21 01:29 AM] king of cats#9205
lmaooo he was a character


[07-Aug-21 01:30 AM] king of cats#9205
i thought they worshipped him


[07-Aug-21 01:30 AM] king of cats#9205
turns out it wasn't a cult


[07-Aug-21 01:30 AM] king of cats#9205
honestly most of the way i've been comprehending life since lockdown has been haikyuu


[07-Aug-21 01:30 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh? lolll sometimes i see usernames and i just subconsciously relate them to tother ppl or things and i get confused when i realize it isnt related


[07-Aug-21 01:31 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ok so many ppl love haikyuu i should really try to get into it but idkkk


[07-Aug-21 01:31 AM] king of cats#9205
same! i saw someone with the username iwa and immediately thought of haikyuu


[07-Aug-21 01:31 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
one of my friends even put it in her college intro bio thing even tho she didnt finish it LMAO she said she had to do research when ppl started dming her afhiuigjkebrgreg


[07-Aug-21 01:31 AM] king of cats#9205
haikyuu is pretty fun and wholesome


[07-Aug-21 01:32 AM] king of cats#9205
the fandom is crazyyy big though


[07-Aug-21 01:32 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
isnt it long tho? i feel like i woudlnt be able to finish


[07-Aug-21 01:32 AM] king of cats#9205
i think i started in 8th grade


[07-Aug-21 01:32 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh yeah i swear everyone knows it lol


[07-Aug-21 01:32 AM] king of cats#9205
i think if you're new, the anime might be easier to do over the manga


[07-Aug-21 01:32 AM] king of cats#9205
the manga is finished but there are around 200 chaps


[07-Aug-21 01:32 AM] king of cats#9205
i mean i love the manga sooooooo


[07-Aug-21 01:32 AM] king of cats#9205
but yeah


[07-Aug-21 01:32 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh gosh


[07-Aug-21 01:33 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
im definitely a binge watcher/reader


[07-Aug-21 01:33 AM] king of cats#9205
the anime has four seasons + the side season


[07-Aug-21 01:33 AM] king of cats#9205
so far


[07-Aug-21 01:33 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
so that wouldnt be good for my uhhh sleep schedule and education esp since school is starting soon and spis lmao


[07-Aug-21 01:33 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ahhh thats why i used to not watch any tv ever i always thought it was too much dedication


[07-Aug-21 01:33 AM] king of cats#9205
sameeeeeeee


[07-Aug-21 01:33 AM] king of cats#9205
that's how i ended up reading manga


[07-Aug-21 01:34 AM] king of cats#9205
and well i couldn't stop myself from reading wayyy too much


[07-Aug-21 01:34 AM] king of cats#9205
but there are a bunch of different fandom related jokes that you end up understanding afterwards ig


[07-Aug-21 01:34 AM] king of cats#9205
so there's that


[07-Aug-21 01:34 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i used to be an avid reader til hs started but yearh i would read til the sun came up if it was a long book/series and i would get in trouble lol


[07-Aug-21 01:35 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ok true i love understanding references


[07-Aug-21 01:35 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
makes me feel in the loop


[07-Aug-21 01:35 AM] king of cats#9205
ahahahah the only person who probably consistently would make those references might be me ahahah


[07-Aug-21 01:35 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
but its also a lot to actually get into it so i just dont do anything most the time


[07-Aug-21 01:35 AM] king of cats#9205
yeah it really takes a lot of time and effort


[07-Aug-21 01:35 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh no ill just have to be confused each time then-


[07-Aug-21 01:35 AM] king of cats#9205
i think i brought up a couple of older references that had people dying


[07-Aug-21 01:35 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ok but that feeling is great


[07-Aug-21 01:36 AM] king of cats#9205
it's funny how i can't remember what i did yesterday, but i remember most everything from haikyuu


[07-Aug-21 01:36 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
afknkdjfnsdansd literally me too but with other fandoms(?) or just things i strangely got into and know too much about


[07-Aug-21 01:36 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
but my memory is too bad i cant actually name these things til it comes up


[07-Aug-21 01:36 AM] king of cats#9205

[07-Aug-21 01:37 AM] king of cats#9205

[07-Aug-21 01:37 AM] king of cats#9205

[07-Aug-21 01:37 AM] crossboy#7777

[07-Aug-21 01:37 AM] crossboy#7777

[07-Aug-21 01:51 AM] king of cats#9205
guess it worked, i blame my ~~cult~~ i mean new guild


[07-Aug-21 01:51 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
yay its so hard for me irl tho


[07-Aug-21 01:51 AM] king of cats#9205
i keep telling myself i'll run out of things to say, and then i don't because my midnight brain always comes up with something weird


[07-Aug-21 01:52 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh night convos are the best


[07-Aug-21 01:52 AM] king of cats#9205
i actually liked irl social interactions, i could walk away


[07-Aug-21 01:52 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
you can kinda go crazy but its so normal


[07-Aug-21 01:52 AM] king of cats#9205
i feel trapped in some online convos, esp when they're private cause i've had people private message me and be creepy


[07-Aug-21 01:52 AM] king of cats#9205
soooo


[07-Aug-21 01:52 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh whattt i feel like walking away is easier online if you rly wanted to


[07-Aug-21 01:53 AM] king of cats#9205
nah i like physically walking away, i think it makes the message clearer


[07-Aug-21 01:53 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ok true uhhh ive gotten strange dms but i never reply unless i know them enough


[07-Aug-21 01:53 AM] king of cats#9205
i got messaged by some dude who i didn't know on snap and we were in the same ucsd group chat


[07-Aug-21 01:53 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
for me my convos irl are usually w ppl i "know" so it feels too rude to just leave


[07-Aug-21 01:53 AM] king of cats#9205
and i got weird vibes


[07-Aug-21 01:53 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
eek


[07-Aug-21 01:53 AM] king of cats#9205
and then turns out he was also messaging another friend of mine in the same gc


[07-Aug-21 01:54 AM] king of cats#9205
and he asked to call with her despite us all only meeting for the first time that day


[07-Aug-21 01:54 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
uhhh giant red flags!


[07-Aug-21 01:54 AM] king of cats#9205
then when i refused to give him my insta, he really stalked me and found me and shamelessly sent me a follow request


[07-Aug-21 01:54 AM] king of cats#9205
so i blocked him on both accounts :p


[07-Aug-21 01:54 AM] Viridion#0234
Bruh


[07-Aug-21 01:54 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
nice block


[07-Aug-21 01:54 AM] king of cats#9205
lmfaooooo


[07-Aug-21 01:54 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
some ppl need to just


[07-Aug-21 01:54 AM] king of cats#9205
that makes me think of haikyuu


[07-Aug-21 01:54 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
think? take a hint? be normaler?


[07-Aug-21 01:55 AM] king of cats#9205
i mean his insta was really weird too


[07-Aug-21 01:55 AM] king of cats#9205
one of my other friends insta stalked him and he had really weird posts about blades and murder?


[07-Aug-21 01:55 AM] king of cats#9205
i don't remember exactly, but it was creepy


[07-Aug-21 01:55 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ummm im concerned


[07-Aug-21 01:55 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
hopefully i never encounter him


[07-Aug-21 01:55 AM] king of cats#9205
s a m e


[07-Aug-21 01:56 AM] king of cats#9205
i will zoom away


[07-Aug-21 01:56 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
this is another reason sometimes i justify my hermit life


[07-Aug-21 01:56 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
why did i imagine you logging on to zoom i think my brain is frying


[07-Aug-21 01:56 AM] king of cats#9205
i honestly got really lonely and bored during the whole zoom life


[07-Aug-21 01:56 AM] king of cats#9205
ahahah i was in track and cross country two years ago


[07-Aug-21 01:56 AM] king of cats#9205
i assume i can run fast enough to get out of a bad situation


[07-Aug-21 01:56 AM] king of cats#9205
though i've never tried


[07-Aug-21 01:56 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ive never had to but i need to do smth about my health


[07-Aug-21 01:57 AM] king of cats#9205
s a me


[07-Aug-21 01:57 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
30 sec of walking makes me tired already


[07-Aug-21 01:57 AM] king of cats#9205
oh i can tolerate walking for a long time


[07-Aug-21 01:57 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
my heart rate is alrd kinda abnormal perhaps because i havent moved


[07-Aug-21 01:57 AM] king of cats#9205
there have been a number of occasions where my family has gotten lost so at this point i'm just like sure whatever


[07-Aug-21 01:57 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i think my walking is getting better lmao but i definitely gotta work on survival skills


[07-Aug-21 01:57 AM] king of cats#9205
ahahahahahahah


[07-Aug-21 01:58 AM] king of cats#9205
honestly though i'm so used to seeing people's pfps that when i see real faces i always end up surprised


[07-Aug-21 01:58 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
my health app was a good 100 steps daily average for the majority of each month and thats really not it


[07-Aug-21 01:58 AM] king of cats#9205
i feel like that's the same for me


[07-Aug-21 01:58 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh my gosh that would be me because i imagine people with their pfps if i talk to them a lot online


[07-Aug-21 01:58 AM] king of cats#9205
i guess people get all shocked that i don't look like tendou satori


[07-Aug-21 01:58 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
LMAO


[07-Aug-21 01:59 AM] king of cats#9205

[07-Aug-21 01:59 AM] king of cats#9205
like pls no


[07-Aug-21 01:59 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678

[07-Aug-21 01:59 AM] king of cats#9205
ahahahahah


[07-Aug-21 01:59 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678

[07-Aug-21 01:59 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oops definitely didnt say that earlier :D


[07-Aug-21 01:59 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i actually despise pictures usually


[07-Aug-21 01:59 AM] Viridion#0234
Perfect, that‚Äôs why my pfp is my fave


[07-Aug-21 01:59 AM] Viridion#0234

[07-Aug-21 02:00 AM] king of cats#9205
oml trueeee


[07-Aug-21 02:00 AM] king of cats#9205
i mean some people have really cute pfps


[07-Aug-21 02:00 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
wont recognize a normal expression


[07-Aug-21 02:00 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
josh's pfp is lovely


[07-Aug-21 02:00 AM] Viridion#0234
Of course, I am in a constant state of despair


[07-Aug-21 02:00 AM] king of cats#9205
y e s


[07-Aug-21 02:00 AM] king of cats#9205
it is


[07-Aug-21 02:00 AM] king of cats#9205
honestly animal pfps are usually the best


[07-Aug-21 02:01 AM] king of cats#9205
but i also really have a soft spot for the haikyuu ones as well


[07-Aug-21 02:01 AM] king of cats#9205
especially the ones from the manga


[07-Aug-21 02:01 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
:oo guess we'll see on zoom on monday


[07-Aug-21 02:01 AM] king of cats#9205
ahahahahahah


[07-Aug-21 02:01 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
lol i dont think ive seen pics of ppl using references i actually know yet


[07-Aug-21 02:01 AM] king of cats#9205
i honestly found a bunch of zoom backgrounds


[07-Aug-21 02:02 AM] king of cats#9205
so i keep swapping them


[07-Aug-21 02:02 AM] king of cats#9205
i usually try to match with whatever i'm wearing and it's kind of a game now


[07-Aug-21 02:02 AM] king of cats#9205
i mean i have yet to see farmer ushijima or deadchi


[07-Aug-21 02:02 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
omg i finally got a laptop last month and i never had the option for legit zoom backgrounds so i havent used any yet


[07-Aug-21 02:02 AM] king of cats#9205
i keep playing with them


[07-Aug-21 02:02 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh now i gotta pay attention to that :p


[07-Aug-21 02:03 AM] king of cats#9205
i also end up stretching a lot ahahha


[07-Aug-21 02:03 AM] king of cats#9205
my inner cat is like stretchy stretchy time


[07-Aug-21 02:03 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i dont even know what i do i just assume im not on anyone's screen üò©


[07-Aug-21 02:03 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ahahahaha


[07-Aug-21 02:03 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
:kitty:


[07-Aug-21 02:03 AM] king of cats#9205
my anxiety makes me hyper aware


[07-Aug-21 02:03 AM] king of cats#9205
especially since once i was unmuted and i told my brother to shut up and my professor was recording


[07-Aug-21 02:03 AM] king of cats#9205
:p


[07-Aug-21 02:03 AM] king of cats#9205
sooooooo


[07-Aug-21 02:04 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh nooo


[07-Aug-21 02:04 AM] king of cats#9205
nightmare moment right there


[07-Aug-21 02:04 AM] king of cats#9205
it's fine though


[07-Aug-21 02:04 AM] king of cats#9205
the recording is probably gone now


[07-Aug-21 02:04 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
im more aware of my mic yeah i kinda check that its muted religiously


[07-Aug-21 02:04 AM] king of cats#9205
sameeeeeeeeee


[07-Aug-21 02:04 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
hopefully ü§û


[07-Aug-21 02:04 AM] king of cats#9205
i get so anxious


[07-Aug-21 02:04 AM] king of cats#9205
and then i also worry about what people see me doing


[07-Aug-21 02:04 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
usually i just make sure my camera is in an ok position then i dont wanna look at myself anymore tho


[07-Aug-21 02:04 AM] king of cats#9205
even if i'm just stretching cause sometimes i like to make faces


[07-Aug-21 02:05 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ahahahah i just sit and stare at the screen and i HOPE i didnt stretch strangely without realizign it


[07-Aug-21 02:05 AM] king of cats#9205
lmaoooo that's also a good way


[07-Aug-21 02:05 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
tho i hate people looking at me, ill never know


[07-Aug-21 02:05 AM] king of cats#9205
i'm gonna miss being able to have a plushie on my table


[07-Aug-21 02:06 AM] king of cats#9205
i don't mind because people kinda stare to start sometimes


[07-Aug-21 02:06 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
aww just carry a small one with you to class hehe


[07-Aug-21 02:06 AM] king of cats#9205
lmaoooo i keep it on my desk


[07-Aug-21 02:06 AM] king of cats#9205
it's a husky and i want to say it's as old as i am if not a bit older


[07-Aug-21 02:07 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
omg i wouldnt want to part with it :(


[07-Aug-21 02:07 AM] king of cats#9205
lmaooooo


[07-Aug-21 02:07 AM] king of cats#9205
it's gonna stay home


[07-Aug-21 02:07 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
but also bringing it to school  would might not turn out too well


[07-Aug-21 02:07 AM] king of cats#9205
although i swear i can't sleep without holding something like a plushie


[07-Aug-21 02:07 AM] king of cats#9205
so i will be bringing a bigger husky plushie for sure


[07-Aug-21 02:07 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ahh i have my sleeping phases where i have to hug a different thing sometimes lol


[07-Aug-21 02:07 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
good idea üòå


[07-Aug-21 02:07 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
at least you wont be as emotionally attached to a new one


[07-Aug-21 02:07 AM] king of cats#9205
i'm more concerned about the people who sleep like a log


[07-Aug-21 02:07 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
just in case dorm life is strange


[07-Aug-21 02:08 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i really dont know how anyone does that


[07-Aug-21 02:08 AM] king of cats#9205
pffft


[07-Aug-21 02:08 AM] king of cats#9205
the husky that's probably as old as i am makes a barking sound


[07-Aug-21 02:08 AM] king of cats#9205
it's one of those old kids toys


[07-Aug-21 02:08 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ooo does it still work


[07-Aug-21 02:08 AM] king of cats#9205
it's a desk ornament, not a plushie really


[07-Aug-21 02:08 AM] king of cats#9205
probably


[07-Aug-21 02:08 AM] king of cats#9205
idk


[07-Aug-21 02:09 AM] king of cats#9205
like i don't hug it or anything


[07-Aug-21 02:09 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
it keeps you company through ~~boring~~ claaases


[07-Aug-21 02:09 AM] king of cats#9205
ahahahahahah


[07-Aug-21 02:09 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i wanna bring a squishy plushie in case i ever want to hug one because the mood is very random and not that often for me


[07-Aug-21 02:10 AM] king of cats#9205
honestly i find it so funny how i want to hug people when it's a pandemic


[07-Aug-21 02:10 AM] king of cats#9205
but when it's not then i'm like what is happening when someone randomly hugs me


[07-Aug-21 02:10 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
lolll i used to despise hugs but then i started only hugging ppl who didntl ike it and now soemtimes i just rly wanna hug someone ya know


[07-Aug-21 02:11 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
butfor me its random so its not like when i actually see ppl i wanna hug them -_-


[07-Aug-21 02:11 AM] king of cats#9205
honestly i don't mind being hugged but that's mainly because i had a few friends who just randomly hugged me


[07-Aug-21 02:11 AM] king of cats#9205
so i'm kind of in a state of okay you want to hug me fine


[07-Aug-21 02:11 AM] king of cats#9205
you want to squish my cheeks, fine


[07-Aug-21 02:11 AM] king of cats#9205
kind of thing


[07-Aug-21 02:12 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh same now but only certain people


[07-Aug-21 02:12 AM] king of cats#9205
i think the only thing i'm usually like oh no is like being picked up physically


[07-Aug-21 02:12 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i couldnt name the conditions but sometimes im repulsed lmaoo


[07-Aug-21 02:12 AM] king of cats#9205
i've had people try to pick me up and it's weird as heckkkkkkkk


[07-Aug-21 02:12 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
thats strange


[07-Aug-21 02:12 AM] king of cats#9205
i know


[07-Aug-21 02:12 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i only allow piggy back rides if its someone i trust


[07-Aug-21 02:12 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
but normal picking up uhh nty


[07-Aug-21 02:13 AM] king of cats#9205
i also happen to have a number of tall friends


[07-Aug-21 02:13 AM] king of cats#9205
it's probably cause they're tall


[07-Aug-21 02:13 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
my friends are all taller so i think theyre tall


[07-Aug-21 02:13 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
but not thattt tall


[07-Aug-21 02:13 AM] king of cats#9205
tall friends tend to have a thing for being like, let me help you experience what it's like to be way too far off the ground


[07-Aug-21 02:13 AM] king of cats#9205
i mean i look not too short with my friends


[07-Aug-21 02:13 AM] king of cats#9205
but some of them are like 6ft?


[07-Aug-21 02:13 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
my friends just use me as an armrest thats it >:(


[07-Aug-21 02:14 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh my


[07-Aug-21 02:14 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i dont think any of my school friends are that tall lol


[07-Aug-21 02:14 AM] king of cats#9205
it's honestly really funny but a lot of the people i know just tower over me


[07-Aug-21 02:14 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
omg theres this guy that i have to just LOOK UP to talk to


[07-Aug-21 02:14 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
and i mention it every time


[07-Aug-21 02:15 AM] king of cats#9205
honestly i swear it's because i'm short


[07-Aug-21 02:15 AM] king of cats#9205
and that's why i always end up wondering how tall people are


[07-Aug-21 02:15 AM] king of cats#9205
because i need to know if they have that potential thought process of "aerin is short and small, i want to lift"

[07-Aug-21 02:20 AM] king of cats#9205

[07-Aug-21 02:22 AM] king of cats#9205
i always forget how tall people are but people at 6ft don't feel too tall to me


[07-Aug-21 02:22 AM] Viridion#0234
Funny story, there were like five Ethan lins total at lynbrook


[07-Aug-21 02:22 AM] king of cats#9205

[07-Aug-21 02:22 AM] Viridion#0234
Three of which were in my year


[07-Aug-21 02:22 AM] king of cats#9205

[07-Aug-21 02:24 AM] king of cats#9205
i suddenly remembered something really stupid


[07-Aug-21 02:24 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ooh yeah him


[07-Aug-21 02:24 AM] king of cats#9205
i had a classmate who i shared the same set of initials with so the teacher asked who had a middle name and he did so he had to put the initial for his middle name as well


[07-Aug-21 02:24 AM] king of cats#9205
and it was frederick or something


[07-Aug-21 02:24 AM] king of cats#9205
but he kept insisting to me that his middle name was pencil sharpener


[07-Aug-21 02:24 AM] king of cats#9205
this was in second grade, mind you


[07-Aug-21 02:25 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
thats an interesting lie


[07-Aug-21 02:25 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
did you believe it lmaoo


[07-Aug-21 02:25 AM] king of cats#9205
no


[07-Aug-21 02:25 AM] king of cats#9205
i thought it was hilarious


[07-Aug-21 02:25 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
2nd grade is just a strange year tho


[07-Aug-21 02:25 AM] king of cats#9205
he also got held back a year


[07-Aug-21 02:25 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh-


[07-Aug-21 02:25 AM] king of cats#9205
like in kindergarten or something


[07-Aug-21 02:25 AM] Viridion#0234
Oh yea similar story


[07-Aug-21 02:26 AM] Viridion#0234
I got the nickname sanic in middle school bc I chose it to differentiate myself from the other Ethan lins


[07-Aug-21 02:26 AM] Viridion#0234
My parents told my middle school that my middle name was S, so I expanded it to sanic


[07-Aug-21 02:27 AM] king of cats#9205
ahahah


[07-Aug-21 02:27 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
did they just let you do that üò©


[07-Aug-21 02:27 AM] king of cats#9205
trueeee


[07-Aug-21 02:27 AM] king of cats#9205
that is an important question


[07-Aug-21 02:27 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh sanic is gone


[07-Aug-21 02:27 AM] king of cats#9205
oop


[07-Aug-21 02:28 AM] king of cats#9205
honestly it's weird having a middle name now


[07-Aug-21 02:28 AM] king of cats#9205
i feel like most people have had one for most of their lives


[07-Aug-21 02:28 AM] king of cats#9205
i actually picked my brother's middle name apparently


[07-Aug-21 02:28 AM] Viridion#0234
Well yes


[07-Aug-21 02:28 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
is your middle name part of the system or does it just register as a nickname?


[07-Aug-21 02:28 AM] king of cats#9205
my parents really just gave me a list and said pick


[07-Aug-21 02:29 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
so influential lmaoo


[07-Aug-21 02:29 AM] king of cats#9205
oh i had an official amendment


[07-Aug-21 02:29 AM] Viridion#0234
For the official documentation it was just S.


[07-Aug-21 02:29 AM] king of cats#9205
i mean all the names started with 'c'


[07-Aug-21 02:29 AM] king of cats#9205
did they ever tell you your actual middle name


[07-Aug-21 02:30 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
wow what if they were quirky and made it "S." lmao dont people use symbols in names now üëÄ


[07-Aug-21 02:30 AM] king of cats#9205
guess they do?


[07-Aug-21 02:30 AM] king of cats#9205
idk i've only heard one instance


[07-Aug-21 02:30 AM] king of cats#9205
i guess they could if they really wanted to


[07-Aug-21 02:31 AM] Viridion#0234
Elon musks kid


[07-Aug-21 02:31 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
exactly what i was thinking


[07-Aug-21 02:31 AM] king of cats#9205
honestly i already have a hard time thinking up names for pets, much less children


[07-Aug-21 02:32 AM] king of cats#9205
scratch that


[07-Aug-21 02:32 AM] king of cats#9205
i can't even name variables, much less pets or children


[07-Aug-21 02:32 AM] king of cats#9205
ahahahah


[07-Aug-21 02:32 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
LOL me thats why my stuffed animals dont even have names


[07-Aug-21 02:32 AM] king of cats#9205
if anything i'm probably going to steal names from tolkein or dvergatal


[07-Aug-21 02:33 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i hope i never have to name someithng


[07-Aug-21 02:33 AM] king of cats#9205
well you might have to name variables and stuff


[07-Aug-21 02:33 AM] king of cats#9205
i also end up having to name essays


[07-Aug-21 02:33 AM] king of cats#9205
and poems


[07-Aug-21 02:33 AM] king of cats#9205
and whatever else my brain comes up with


[07-Aug-21 02:33 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh my gosh yeah those are hard enough


[07-Aug-21 02:33 AM] king of cats#9205
and then it turns into what in the actual world does any of this mean


[07-Aug-21 02:34 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i think one year when my teacher cared about essay names i woukd actaully get points off


[07-Aug-21 02:34 AM] king of cats#9205
so when people ask i smile and laugh


[07-Aug-21 02:34 AM] king of cats#9205
i just follow a format


[07-Aug-21 02:34 AM] king of cats#9205
i put random synonyms together


[07-Aug-21 02:34 AM] king of cats#9205
and then i say here you go


[07-Aug-21 02:34 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
big brain


[07-Aug-21 02:34 AM] king of cats#9205
but for poems and stuff i just use whatever really random, abstract thing comes up in my brain first


[07-Aug-21 02:35 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
sometimes i give up and im like "1984 essay"


[07-Aug-21 02:35 AM] king of cats#9205
ahahahah


[07-Aug-21 02:35 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i havent written a poem since 9th so havent thought about that!


[07-Aug-21 02:35 AM] king of cats#9205
i mean people tend to find deeper meanings in poems


[07-Aug-21 02:35 AM] king of cats#9205
so i assume they'd do the same with titles


[07-Aug-21 02:35 AM] king of cats#9205
it's one of those tricks


[07-Aug-21 02:35 AM] king of cats#9205
kinda like how people find random deeper meaning in art sometimes


[07-Aug-21 02:36 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oooh yes there are so many interpretations of things that werent even supposed to be things


[07-Aug-21 02:36 AM] king of cats#9205
and i just happen to remember the names of random artists and some of their works


[07-Aug-21 02:36 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
(as you can see my word usage is great)


[07-Aug-21 02:36 AM] king of cats#9205
i learned some art history as a child


[07-Aug-21 02:36 AM] king of cats#9205
so i know a decent bit about older art


[07-Aug-21 02:36 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh i know 0 abput art


[07-Aug-21 02:36 AM] king of cats#9205
it's honestly just part of the random stuff i happen to know


[07-Aug-21 02:37 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
even tho i took classes before and we learned a bit of that


[07-Aug-21 02:37 AM] king of cats#9205
lmaooo i learned it when i was really young


[07-Aug-21 02:37 AM] king of cats#9205
it was kinda drilled into my brain


[07-Aug-21 02:37 AM] king of cats#9205
just like how to play black jack


[07-Aug-21 02:37 AM] king of cats#9205
and playing hidden object games


[07-Aug-21 02:37 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ahh even games ive played sooo many times, i still need a refresher if i havent played in a while


[07-Aug-21 02:37 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
its so bad


[07-Aug-21 02:38 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i need to fix my memory


[07-Aug-21 02:38 AM] king of cats#9205
lmaooo


[07-Aug-21 02:38 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
idk how tho lol my parents just say SLEEP


[07-Aug-21 02:38 AM] king of cats#9205
i don't know why i remember how to play blackjack so clearly


[07-Aug-21 02:38 AM] king of cats#9205
honestly same


[07-Aug-21 02:38 AM] king of cats#9205
i have memory loss


[07-Aug-21 02:38 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
litearlly my mom questions why my memory is worse than hers and im at a loss for words


[07-Aug-21 02:38 AM] king of cats#9205
and sometimes when i google memory loss and i look at the specific kind  i might have


[07-Aug-21 02:38 AM] king of cats#9205
i end up asking myself if google might be accurate when it gives me dementia


[07-Aug-21 02:39 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
googling symptoms is


[07-Aug-21 02:39 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
sketchy


[07-Aug-21 02:39 AM] king of cats#9205
ahahah


[07-Aug-21 02:39 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
but same üò©


[07-Aug-21 02:39 AM] king of cats#9205
i've had people tell me i asked them the same question five or six times


[07-Aug-21 02:39 AM] king of cats#9205
and every single time i say "wait really?"


[07-Aug-21 02:39 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
same same or they say something i didnt know i told them and im like :surprised:


[07-Aug-21 02:39 AM] king of cats#9205
i also remember almost nothing about my childhood or even like more recent stuff


[07-Aug-21 02:40 AM] king of cats#9205
everything goes in my brain and leaves again


[07-Aug-21 02:40 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
im always paranoid ill repeat a story or thing to someone i told before and theyll think i didnt care to remembe ror smth


[07-Aug-21 02:40 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ackkk same


[07-Aug-21 02:40 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i barely have memories of the house i lived in til literally end of 5th grade


[07-Aug-21 02:40 AM] king of cats#9205
my worst anxiety is that i've said something bad and people remember


[07-Aug-21 02:40 AM] king of cats#9205
and then they'll ask me what i meant


[07-Aug-21 02:40 AM] king of cats#9205
and i won't know because no memories


[07-Aug-21 02:41 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
confrontation ESPECIALLY for things i litearll ydont recall are the worst


[07-Aug-21 02:41 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i just cant deal w it


[07-Aug-21 02:41 AM] king of cats#9205
ahahah worst part is that when i do briefly remember things


[07-Aug-21 02:41 AM] king of cats#9205
i always end up realizing that the people i knew growing up were crappy people when i knew them


[07-Aug-21 02:41 AM] king of cats#9205
so then i feel like whatever cause you were horrid too


[07-Aug-21 02:42 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
awh my brief memoreis usually end up in me intensely cringing at myself


[07-Aug-21 02:42 AM] king of cats#9205
and it's so ridiculous


[07-Aug-21 02:42 AM] king of cats#9205
that too


[07-Aug-21 02:42 AM] king of cats#9205
but usually i end up remembering why i don't talk to some people and stuff


[07-Aug-21 02:42 AM] king of cats#9205
but i've been meeting less and less crappy people now


[07-Aug-21 02:42 AM] king of cats#9205
so that's gotta be a good thing :3


[07-Aug-21 02:43 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
just forget about those people who werent good for you !! easier said than done sometimes


[07-Aug-21 02:43 AM] king of cats#9205
the fact that there are only four of us online ahahah


[07-Aug-21 02:43 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
yayy hopefully that keeps improving


[07-Aug-21 02:43 AM] king of cats#9205
i forget them


[07-Aug-21 02:43 AM] king of cats#9205
often and then accidentally offend them


[07-Aug-21 02:43 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh its 2:43?! what happened to the time


[07-Aug-21 02:43 AM] king of cats#9205
ahahah


[07-Aug-21 02:43 AM] king of cats#9205
is what i ask myself


[07-Aug-21 02:43 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
but then it doesnt really matter anymore


[07-Aug-21 02:43 AM] king of cats#9205
i just like being wide awake at night


[07-Aug-21 02:43 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678

[07-Aug-21 02:43 AM] king of cats#9205

[07-Aug-21 02:47 AM] crossboy#7777

i just want to go to the aquarium sooooooo


[07-Aug-21 02:47 AM] king of cats#9205
:p


[07-Aug-21 02:47 AM] crossboy#7777
the aquariam is soooooooooo cool


[07-Aug-21 02:47 AM] crossboy#7777
there's a shuttle that runs between it and ucsd (at least pre covid)


[07-Aug-21 02:47 AM] king of cats#9205
that sounds fun


[07-Aug-21 02:47 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oo i dont actually know much about the campus so itll be fun to explore


[07-Aug-21 02:47 AM] king of cats#9205
my uncle was an alum from a long time ago and he told me i could get around just fine with a shuttle


[07-Aug-21 02:48 AM] crossboy#7777
yup, plus you get a free bus pass that works for like 95% of the lines in san diego


[07-Aug-21 02:48 AM] king of cats#9205
i just wanna run down to the aquarium


[07-Aug-21 02:48 AM] king of cats#9205
that's literally it


[07-Aug-21 02:48 AM] crossboy#7777
so you can get around super easily


[07-Aug-21 02:48 AM] king of cats#9205
everything else is not that interesting ahahah


[07-Aug-21 02:48 AM] king of cats#9205
that is so niceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee


[07-Aug-21 02:48 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oooh nice i hope the shuttles work


[07-Aug-21 02:48 AM] king of cats#9205

[07-Aug-21 02:49 AM] king of cats#9205
i have no clue where cogsci is at all


[07-Aug-21 02:49 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh truuee


[07-Aug-21 02:49 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i just remember looking it up on the map and using the walking tool to see how long itd take


[07-Aug-21 02:49 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i forgot what it said tho


[07-Aug-21 02:49 AM] king of cats#9205
i hope it's not in the warren area


[07-Aug-21 02:49 AM] crossboy#7777
cogsci is pretty close to geisel!


[07-Aug-21 02:49 AM] king of cats#9205
ohhhhhhhhhh that is going to be funnnnnnnn


[07-Aug-21 02:49 AM] crossboy#7777
so like middle of campus, but a little more left


[07-Aug-21 02:50 AM] crossboy#7777
(if you are looking at it top down)


[07-Aug-21 02:50 AM] king of cats#9205
i can get my exercise in ig :p


[07-Aug-21 02:50 AM] crossboy#7777
yuppp you definitely get your steps in ehre xD


[07-Aug-21 02:50 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh i was gonna say i think a lot of ppl study there so if needed i might just crash there lmaoo


[07-Aug-21 02:50 AM] king of cats#9205
i wish i actually found geisel interesting enough to remember the architect's name smh


[07-Aug-21 02:50 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i tell myself this is a good way to improve my health


[07-Aug-21 02:50 AM] king of cats#9205
some of the housing at ucla is done by john lautner


[07-Aug-21 02:50 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
but im also dreading it


[07-Aug-21 02:50 AM] crossboy#7777
im terrible with names so i have no clue xD


[07-Aug-21 02:51 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh i dont know a single architect ever


[07-Aug-21 02:51 AM] king of cats#9205
i only remember around 10 names for architects at most


[07-Aug-21 02:51 AM] king of cats#9205
and most of them had random buildings that i just found pretty


[07-Aug-21 02:51 AM] crossboy#7777
haha that's awesome


[07-Aug-21 02:51 AM] king of cats#9205
i probably know more renaissancce artists off the top of my head though


[07-Aug-21 02:51 AM] crossboy#7777
ooo that's neat


[07-Aug-21 02:51 AM] crossboy#7777
what made you remember those?


[07-Aug-21 02:51 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
good for trivia yay!


[07-Aug-21 02:51 AM] king of cats#9205
my mom taught me art history and used to drill me


[07-Aug-21 02:51 AM] king of cats#9205
we had this book with a card game


[07-Aug-21 02:52 AM] king of cats#9205
and i must have memorize the names before i knew it


[07-Aug-21 02:52 AM] crossboy#7777
huh that's interesting


[07-Aug-21 02:52 AM] crossboy#7777
why art hsitory?


[07-Aug-21 02:52 AM] king of cats#9205
i think that's why i got into reading mirror text too and font names


[07-Aug-21 02:52 AM] king of cats#9205
my mom likes art


[07-Aug-21 02:52 AM] king of cats#9205
idk


[07-Aug-21 02:52 AM] king of cats#9205
i just know


[07-Aug-21 02:52 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
sadly i forgot most the random info i used to know


[07-Aug-21 02:53 AM] king of cats#9205
i know a number of fonts by name


[07-Aug-21 02:53 AM] king of cats#9205
it keeps me busy when i'm bored


[07-Aug-21 02:53 AM] king of cats#9205
i play a guessing game and try to determine whether someone's using google or microsoft based on font


[07-Aug-21 02:53 AM] king of cats#9205
i also know some of the apple fonts


[07-Aug-21 02:54 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
that‚Äôs so interesting


[07-Aug-21 02:54 AM] king of cats#9205
it's honestly very useless information


[07-Aug-21 02:54 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
haven‚Äôt heard of anyone who does that


[07-Aug-21 02:54 AM] king of cats#9205
but presentations are so boring sometimes


[07-Aug-21 02:54 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
LOL true gotta spice it up


[07-Aug-21 02:54 AM] king of cats#9205
lmaoooooo


[07-Aug-21 02:55 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i think i could only name times new roman and some strange fancy fonts i used to like a while back


[07-Aug-21 02:55 AM] king of cats#9205
ohhhhhhh those are pretty cool


[07-Aug-21 02:55 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
cringing at how i used to use child flowery font on presentations and stuff


[07-Aug-21 02:55 AM] crossboy#7777
i hateeee timse new roman but that might just be because i hate writing essays lolol


[07-Aug-21 02:55 AM] king of cats#9205
i usually just use some kind of sans serif or serif font


[07-Aug-21 02:56 AM] king of cats#9205
i don't like times new roman cause it's times new roman and prefer palatino


[07-Aug-21 02:56 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
tnr just reminds me of school and mla:(


[07-Aug-21 02:56 AM] crossboy#7777
same


[07-Aug-21 02:56 AM] king of cats#9205
i honestly just keep one original copy of the formatting and fill everything else in


[07-Aug-21 02:56 AM] crossboy#7777
i set my default font on google drive to times new roman to save time and i will be so happy the day i can change it to something fun


[07-Aug-21 02:56 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i think i used to use comic sans unironically but we don‚Äôt speak about that anymore


[07-Aug-21 02:56 AM] king of cats#9205
i honestly find essays and english the easiest of all classes


[07-Aug-21 02:57 AM] king of cats#9205
i used to love timed essays


[07-Aug-21 02:57 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i did that too on my old school account but that‚Äôs deleted now agh i should‚Äôve changed it


[07-Aug-21 02:57 AM] king of cats#9205
and i think my teacher hated me for loving timed essays


[07-Aug-21 02:57 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i don‚Äôt agree with you uhhh do you wanna take mmw for me LMAO


[07-Aug-21 02:57 AM] king of cats#9205
well he didn't actually hate me


[07-Aug-21 02:57 AM] king of cats#9205
i was one of his favorite students


[07-Aug-21 02:57 AM] king of cats#9205
but i would write a ton of pages of stuff


[07-Aug-21 02:57 AM] king of cats#9205
it was usually pretty thick when i was finally done


[07-Aug-21 02:58 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ok i used to like them bc my take home essays were basically timed because i would procrastinate soo much and they‚Äôd be the same quality


[07-Aug-21 02:58 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh my that‚Äôs more work for the teacher tho


[07-Aug-21 02:58 AM] king of cats#9205
yeahh


[07-Aug-21 02:58 AM] king of cats#9205
imagine how the person grading my whap test felt


[07-Aug-21 02:58 AM] king of cats#9205
they probably felt like they got slapped with a giant tidal wave of words


[07-Aug-21 02:58 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
maybe they saw the stack and just gave it a good grade :D


[07-Aug-21 02:58 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
lmaoo


[07-Aug-21 02:59 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
reminds me of how ppl would say to just ramble on act essay and you‚Äôd do well


[07-Aug-21 02:59 AM] king of cats#9205
i'm just really quick to make thing sup


[07-Aug-21 02:59 AM] king of cats#9205
oml that act essay is so easy


[07-Aug-21 02:59 AM] king of cats#9205
so was the sat essay


[07-Aug-21 02:59 AM] king of cats#9205
except that one time where i got a low score for arguing against the prompt


[07-Aug-21 02:59 AM] king of cats#9205
but we don't talk about that


[07-Aug-21 02:59 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i did better on the act one for both parts lol


[07-Aug-21 02:59 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
sad moment when i remmeber that they did nothing for my admissions


[07-Aug-21 02:59 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
LOL


[07-Aug-21 02:59 AM] king of cats#9205
i thought the essay was the easiest part of the standardized test


[07-Aug-21 02:59 AM] king of cats#9205
i was so bad with math


[07-Aug-21 03:00 AM] king of cats#9205
i really got a 27 on math


[07-Aug-21 03:00 AM] king of cats#9205
even though i did calc ab


[07-Aug-21 03:00 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i definitely didn‚Äôt like the essay


[07-Aug-21 03:00 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ripp sometimes it‚Äôs easier without the higher level knowledge tho because i think it only went to geo or alg


[07-Aug-21 03:00 AM] king of cats#9205
honestly that is so fair


[07-Aug-21 03:01 AM] king of cats#9205
ngl i did terrible in precalc/trig as in i understood almost nothing


[07-Aug-21 03:01 AM] king of cats#9205
and i still did just fine in calculus ab


[07-Aug-21 03:01 AM] king of cats#9205
i left with an a


[07-Aug-21 03:01 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
reminds me of how i tried tot tutor a 6th grader in a class i never took bc i skipped it... they were learning smth SO USELESS i didn‚Äôt know how to do it aidkskckdkcd


[07-Aug-21 03:01 AM] king of cats#9205
then a semester later i had to drop calc bc because it was like gibberish to me


[07-Aug-21 03:01 AM] crossboy#7777
uhm an a in calc is more than just fine


[07-Aug-21 03:01 AM] crossboy#7777
you did great!


[07-Aug-21 03:01 AM] king of cats#9205
ahahahah


[07-Aug-21 03:02 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
hmm i did rly well in precancerous but bc was much more difficult but i did well bc the ap test was online and there wasn‚Äôt mcq lmao


[07-Aug-21 03:02 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
um autocorrect i mean prevalent


[07-Aug-21 03:02 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
precancerous


[07-Aug-21 03:02 AM] king of cats#9205
i was lucky my professor took out the part of the final on integrals since everyone bombed that part


[07-Aug-21 03:02 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
PRE CALC


[07-Aug-21 03:02 AM] crossboy#7777
xDDDDD


[07-Aug-21 03:02 AM] king of cats#9205
ahahah


[07-Aug-21 03:02 AM] crossboy#7777
integrals suck so that's so valid


[07-Aug-21 03:02 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
my phone hates me


[07-Aug-21 03:02 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i agree i forgot how it even works


[07-Aug-21 03:02 AM] king of cats#9205
i only like derivatives


[07-Aug-21 03:02 AM] king of cats#9205
and my stats class was wayyyyyy better


[07-Aug-21 03:02 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
derivatives are easier and you don‚Äôt have to +c it


[07-Aug-21 03:03 AM] king of cats#9205
i just got to use my calculator and not show most of my work


[07-Aug-21 03:03 AM] crossboy#7777
derivatives and limits are great, integrals are the worst


[07-Aug-21 03:03 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
lol stats annoyed me there was too much writing


[07-Aug-21 03:03 AM] crossboy#7777
calc b is a worse jump than calc c tho (imo) so it doesn't scale up forever


[07-Aug-21 03:03 AM] king of cats#9205
i literally took ab and bc back to back in semesters and still forgot integrals


[07-Aug-21 03:03 AM] king of cats#9205
so now i have to retake bc cause i dropped it


[07-Aug-21 03:04 AM] crossboy#7777
its okay you can take fewer courses whenever you have to take calc b (if you want to)!


[07-Aug-21 03:04 AM] crossboy#7777
you probably will have to do calc c as well but it's not as bad as calc b imo


[07-Aug-21 03:04 AM] king of cats#9205
lmao i have most of my ges done so i can't put it off much longer to begin with lmaoooo


[07-Aug-21 03:04 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
as of now i only need linear algebra but if i try to change something about my path then i might need to do 20c whatever that is and i don‚Äôt wanna have to relearn


[07-Aug-21 03:05 AM] crossboy#7777
20c is calc c


[07-Aug-21 03:05 AM] crossboy#7777
it's not too bad imo


[07-Aug-21 03:05 AM] king of cats#9205
oh that is going to be fun in the most painful way possible


[07-Aug-21 03:05 AM] crossboy#7777
doing multidimensional derivatives sounds terrible but it's not actually that bad


[07-Aug-21 03:05 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
for cogsci it isn‚Äôt required *i think*


[07-Aug-21 03:05 AM] crossboy#7777
it's literally just do the derivative twice


[07-Aug-21 03:05 AM] crossboy#7777
and that's pretty much the whole calss


[07-Aug-21 03:05 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh what


[07-Aug-21 03:05 AM] crossboy#7777
"do this thing you alreayd know how to do, but do it twice instead"


[07-Aug-21 03:05 AM] king of cats#9205
that is actually kinda nice


[07-Aug-21 03:06 AM] crossboy#7777
yah its definitely not as hard of a jump as b is lolol


[07-Aug-21 03:06 AM] king of cats#9205
b is not a jump


[07-Aug-21 03:06 AM] king of cats#9205
it's a shove


[07-Aug-21 03:06 AM] king of cats#9205
off a cliff


[07-Aug-21 03:06 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
it doesn‚Äôt sound too bad now but idk you might just be very smart lolll


[07-Aug-21 03:06 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i don‚Äôt even know if calc bc also teaches a? never understood the system


[07-Aug-21 03:07 AM] crossboy#7777
there is some other stuff that's new too ofc but it's definitely not the worst thing in the world


[07-Aug-21 03:07 AM] king of cats#9205
it's fine though, i think my current existing college gpa can carry me even if i mess up two math classes


[07-Aug-21 03:07 AM] crossboy#7777
ya plus you might be able to take some stuff p/np as well (can't remember if math is able to be) so that's always an option


[07-Aug-21 03:07 AM] king of cats#9205
whenever i see p/np i think of that millenium problem


[07-Aug-21 03:08 AM] crossboy#7777
which problem?


[07-Aug-21 03:09 AM] king of cats#9205
it's one of those very difficult to solve math problems that has like a huge reward if you can get the correct solution


[07-Aug-21 03:09 AM] crossboy#7777
OH THAT P/NP


[07-Aug-21 03:09 AM] king of cats#9205
i want to say that one of them did get solved but i also might have remembered wrong


[07-Aug-21 03:09 AM] crossboy#7777
yeah it's a huge problem in math/cs, it might get covered in spis a bit but im not sure


[07-Aug-21 03:09 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i‚Äôve never heard of it i just searched it up lmao


[07-Aug-21 03:09 AM] king of cats#9205
i know they mentioned p/np but not the actual problem itself


[07-Aug-21 03:10 AM] king of cats#9205
i was watching gifted and the millenium problems came up


[07-Aug-21 03:10 AM] king of cats#9205
along with the trachtenberg method i think


[07-Aug-21 03:10 AM] king of cats#9205
i remember uselessly large words and then when i need to use them my brain goes b l a n k


[07-Aug-21 03:10 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
sounds like another last name


[07-Aug-21 03:10 AM] king of cats#9205
trachtenberg is a last name


[07-Aug-21 03:11 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
my brain forgets sooo many words it makes me so annoyed during timed essays because i can‚Äôt think about what that random common word is


[07-Aug-21 03:11 AM] king of cats#9205
i am usually that one student who is technically done but keeps writing anyway


[07-Aug-21 03:11 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
yeah all these equations  and methods named after people just confuse me


[07-Aug-21 03:11 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
could never relate


[07-Aug-21 03:12 AM] crossboy#7777
hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia is permanently etched into my brain


[07-Aug-21 03:12 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i usually have half my paper written and it‚Äôs just unfinished


[07-Aug-21 03:12 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
that word sounds strangely familiar


[07-Aug-21 03:12 AM] king of cats#9205
i know i have a large vocabulary


[07-Aug-21 03:12 AM] king of cats#9205
i just never use it


[07-Aug-21 03:12 AM] crossboy#7777
it's the fear of long words xD


[07-Aug-21 03:12 AM] king of cats#9205
and i really like learning those random words from tumblr that are so rarely used


[07-Aug-21 03:12 AM] king of cats#9205
and then i don't use them


[07-Aug-21 03:13 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i love that


[07-Aug-21 03:13 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i think i used to do that


[07-Aug-21 03:13 AM] king of cats#9205
the only time those tumblr words ever come into use is when yet another person titles a fanfic using one of those


[07-Aug-21 03:13 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
like defenestrate


[07-Aug-21 03:13 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i‚Äôm surprised i actually remembered one of the strange words i learned


[07-Aug-21 03:13 AM] king of cats#9205
i learned words like gracile


[07-Aug-21 03:13 AM] king of cats#9205
which i never use


[07-Aug-21 03:14 AM] king of cats#9205
and then i randomly apply chemistry terminology to real life


[07-Aug-21 03:14 AM] king of cats#9205
despite sleeping through my chemistry honors class during my second semester


[07-Aug-21 03:14 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
doesn‚Äôt even sound english tbh


[07-Aug-21 03:14 AM] king of cats#9205
i still don't know how i got an a in that class


[07-Aug-21 03:14 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
lolll i like randomly throwing in chem bc that class actually interested me


[07-Aug-21 03:14 AM] king of cats#9205
and my chem 1a was carried by huge extra credit


[07-Aug-21 03:14 AM] king of cats#9205
i overuse state function


[07-Aug-21 03:14 AM] king of cats#9205
not in the literal sense


[07-Aug-21 03:15 AM] king of cats#9205
but i just use it to mean like the process isn't important, just the destination


[07-Aug-21 03:15 AM] king of cats#9205
i think i've also equated people to the different elemental groups before


[07-Aug-21 03:15 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh lmaoo i was thinking boit it


[07-Aug-21 03:15 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
wow


[07-Aug-21 03:15 AM] king of cats#9205
and people always look at me funny for it


[07-Aug-21 03:15 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i would probably tbh LOL


[07-Aug-21 03:15 AM] king of cats#9205
not that i find it important how they feel lmfao


[07-Aug-21 03:15 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
you just seem like a metalloid today


[07-Aug-21 03:16 AM] king of cats#9205
i'll just be like "noble gas personality type" out of the blue


[07-Aug-21 03:16 AM] king of cats#9205
or i'll say someone's like a halogen


[07-Aug-21 03:16 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh wait groups not properties see i forogt most my chem oops


[07-Aug-21 03:16 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
wait i could see the noble gas tho


[07-Aug-21 03:16 AM] king of cats#9205
i think the weirdest thing i've ever done was try to convert all my writing into old english runes


[07-Aug-21 03:17 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
maybe even alkaline earth it‚Äôs strange


[07-Aug-21 03:17 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh i really can‚Äôt deal w old english


[07-Aug-21 03:17 AM] king of cats#9205
old english and old english runes are different


[07-Aug-21 03:17 AM] king of cats#9205
the runes looked a lot like dwarvish from lotr


[07-Aug-21 03:17 AM] king of cats#9205
and i thought they were pretty


[07-Aug-21 03:17 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
OH


[07-Aug-21 03:17 AM] king of cats#9205
yeah


[07-Aug-21 03:17 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i just searched it ok


[07-Aug-21 03:18 AM] king of cats#9205
i mean before that i wanted to write mirror script but being left handed, i technically could have done that to start


[07-Aug-21 03:18 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
gives me hieroglyph vibes


[07-Aug-21 03:18 AM] king of cats#9205
yeah it really does


[07-Aug-21 03:18 AM] king of cats#9205
there's also elvish which is pretty


[07-Aug-21 03:18 AM] king of cats#9205
i also at one point wanted to be ambidextrous


[07-Aug-21 03:18 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
have you practiced mirror script at all?


[07-Aug-21 03:18 AM] king of cats#9205
so i can kinda write with my right hand


[07-Aug-21 03:18 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oo elvish looks mystical


[07-Aug-21 03:18 AM] king of cats#9205
i mean i usually don't but i can do it alright


[07-Aug-21 03:19 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ahahah i used to practice my left


[07-Aug-21 03:19 AM] king of cats#9205
i can read mirrored text just fine


[07-Aug-21 03:19 AM] king of cats#9205
i can technically draw with my right hand using a mouse


[07-Aug-21 03:19 AM] king of cats#9205
but not with a pencil


[07-Aug-21 03:19 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
there were a few stages where i literally would use my left in school but then i started to need to write fast and that didn‚Äôt work


[07-Aug-21 03:19 AM] king of cats#9205
not that well


[07-Aug-21 03:19 AM] king of cats#9205
ahahah when i write fast i end up with print-cursive


[07-Aug-21 03:20 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i‚Äôve never tried because i just can‚Äôt draw at all with anything LOL


[07-Aug-21 03:20 AM] king of cats#9205
the only thing i can consistently draw are cats


[07-Aug-21 03:20 AM] king of cats#9205
and sometimes bears


[07-Aug-21 03:20 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
my handwriting is pretty bad it looks scribbly because i end up connecting everythibg


[07-Aug-21 03:20 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i need to learn how to draw cute animals


[07-Aug-21 03:20 AM] king of cats#9205
i learned cursive and now i mix my print and cursive


[07-Aug-21 03:20 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
like just stick figure version


[07-Aug-21 03:20 AM] king of cats#9205
it looks confusing as heck though reading my notes


[07-Aug-21 03:21 AM] king of cats#9205
usually when i write words that end in ing, the i disappears


[07-Aug-21 03:21 AM] king of cats#9205
it just leaves


[07-Aug-21 03:21 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i guess some of my writing is cursive because of how it connects but i usually don‚Äôt write things like the cursive s anymore


[07-Aug-21 03:21 AM] king of cats#9205
i also don't dot my i's anymore sooooooooo


[07-Aug-21 03:21 AM] king of cats#9205
my i's and e's look similar


[07-Aug-21 03:21 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i haven‚Äôt written in so long i can‚Äôt remmeber how i write


[07-Aug-21 03:21 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
many times when i write my names i don‚Äôt write 2 n‚Äôs properly


[07-Aug-21 03:22 AM] king of cats#9205
ahahahah i write things down by hand


[07-Aug-21 03:22 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i just have some lumpy scribbled


[07-Aug-21 03:22 AM] king of cats#9205
i tend to forget otherwise


[07-Aug-21 03:22 AM] king of cats#9205
cause if i type i sometimes i forget to check where i left whatever i wrote down


[07-Aug-21 03:22 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ah i like typing bc i‚Äôll forget anyways LOL


[07-Aug-21 03:22 AM] king of cats#9205
honestly i just realized


[07-Aug-21 03:22 AM] king of cats#9205
i'm kinda like a function


[07-Aug-21 03:22 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh i guess sometimes it doesn‚Äôt motivate me to read notes as much but


[07-Aug-21 03:22 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
hmm


[07-Aug-21 03:22 AM] king of cats#9205
i just take in input, create an output


[07-Aug-21 03:23 AM] king of cats#9205
and then i forget everything again


[07-Aug-21 03:23 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
LOL


[07-Aug-21 03:23 AM] king of cats#9205
it actually explains why i have no clue what i've turned in for the most part


[07-Aug-21 03:23 AM] king of cats#9205
especially my essays, thank goodness no one asks me to explain those


[07-Aug-21 03:23 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
Won‚Äôt comment on that bc i don‚Äôt wanna say some strange incorrect code thing in a cs server üò©


[07-Aug-21 03:23 AM] king of cats#9205
ahahah i made my brother so frustrated


[07-Aug-21 03:23 AM] king of cats#9205
he was trying to help me check my code


[07-Aug-21 03:23 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
o m g do you just turn in assignments or tests and completely forget the topic or prompt


[07-Aug-21 03:24 AM] king of cats#9205
and then he was like wth


[07-Aug-21 03:24 AM] king of cats#9205
oh i don't even really remember the prompt after i write it


[07-Aug-21 03:24 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i tried to ask my sis but i forgot she knows nothing üò≠


[07-Aug-21 03:24 AM] king of cats#9205
ahahah


[07-Aug-21 03:24 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ikr people ask what i wrote about and i‚Äôm like ... what did we even do


[07-Aug-21 03:24 AM] king of cats#9205
i literally just try to think of the easiest way to solve the problem so i can write almost zero code


[07-Aug-21 03:24 AM] king of cats#9205
i mean i just make something up


[07-Aug-21 03:25 AM] king of cats#9205
if i get a hint of what i should say, i can usually make something up


[07-Aug-21 03:25 AM] king of cats#9205
guess the theatre classes i took panned out years ago


[07-Aug-21 03:25 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i wanna write less but my brain doenst process til after i do smth rly convoluted lmao


[07-Aug-21 03:25 AM] king of cats#9205
ahhhhhh same


[07-Aug-21 03:26 AM] king of cats#9205
i usually say something and then i end up overexplaining myself


[07-Aug-21 03:26 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oo theater fun fun those classes scare me tho


[07-Aug-21 03:26 AM] king of cats#9205
they give me so much anxiety


[07-Aug-21 03:26 AM] king of cats#9205
but i also did them ig


[07-Aug-21 03:26 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
that‚Äôs me 50% of the time


[07-Aug-21 03:26 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
if i do speak i‚Äôll overspeak


[07-Aug-21 03:26 AM] king of cats#9205
technically i guess i can act, i'm good with expressions


[07-Aug-21 03:26 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
but a lot of times i just don‚Äôt speak at all lol


[07-Aug-21 03:26 AM] king of cats#9205
ahahah


[07-Aug-21 03:26 AM] king of cats#9205
when we had to do closing circle i really wrote out what i was going to say


[07-Aug-21 03:27 AM] king of cats#9205
i still panicked anyway ahahah


[07-Aug-21 03:27 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oo i just know i did one acting thing as a child and i laugh sm when i watch now and wonder what the heck happened to me


[07-Aug-21 03:27 AM] king of cats#9205
i used to do musicals so theoretically i should be okay with like idk stages?


[07-Aug-21 03:27 AM] king of cats#9205
but i'm not


[07-Aug-21 03:27 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh i didn‚Äôt get to go today :( how was it? forogt to ask someone about it


[07-Aug-21 03:27 AM] king of cats#9205
it took a long time


[07-Aug-21 03:27 AM] king of cats#9205
and everyone just kinda thanked other people


[07-Aug-21 03:28 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i used to have the worst stage fright (probably still do)


[07-Aug-21 03:28 AM] king of cats#9205
and i just read whatever i wrote while panicking


[07-Aug-21 03:28 AM] king of cats#9205
oh i have stage fright too


[07-Aug-21 03:28 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
aw that‚Äôs nice i would probably not wanna speak up tho lmao


[07-Aug-21 03:28 AM] king of cats#9205
the deer in the headlights


[07-Aug-21 03:28 AM] king of cats#9205
oh it was mandatory for everyone


[07-Aug-21 03:28 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh


[07-Aug-21 03:28 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
well


[07-Aug-21 03:29 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
guess i‚Äôll experience it next week


[07-Aug-21 03:29 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ajejdkskckdkck


[07-Aug-21 03:29 AM] king of cats#9205
i swear things were easier when we were kids


[07-Aug-21 03:29 AM] king of cats#9205
like being on stage and stuff


[07-Aug-21 03:29 AM] king of cats#9205
i don't know how i did it then


[07-Aug-21 03:29 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
everything was easier then


[07-Aug-21 03:29 AM] king of cats#9205
it really wassss


[07-Aug-21 03:29 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i really wanna channel my younger energy


[07-Aug-21 03:29 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
but i cannot comprehend


[07-Aug-21 03:29 AM] king of cats#9205
honestly i was thinking back to the musicals i did


[07-Aug-21 03:29 AM] king of cats#9205
and i just realized how weirdly sexist my fair lady was


[07-Aug-21 03:30 AM] king of cats#9205
like there's this whole song when the english professor rants about women


[07-Aug-21 03:30 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i don‚Äôt rly know musicals well but i guess many were made back in the day where it was normal to be misogynistic


[07-Aug-21 03:30 AM] king of cats#9205
trueeeee


[07-Aug-21 03:31 AM] king of cats#9205
honestly i got into musicals because of my parents


[07-Aug-21 03:31 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i think a few years ago i wanted to try to do a musical but obviously my stage fright completely killed that


[07-Aug-21 03:31 AM] king of cats#9205
awwwwwwwwwwwwwwww


[07-Aug-21 03:31 AM] king of cats#9205
i think the first musical i saw was les mis or phantom


[07-Aug-21 03:31 AM] king of cats#9205
i didn't understand the lovely ladies thing until like years later


[07-Aug-21 03:31 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oo do your parents watch a lot


[07-Aug-21 03:31 AM] king of cats#9205
no not really


[07-Aug-21 03:31 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
my first (and only i think) was phantom


[07-Aug-21 03:32 AM] king of cats#9205
my dad just had them and i was introduced to them early


[07-Aug-21 03:32 AM] king of cats#9205
although i watched ghibli films long before that


[07-Aug-21 03:32 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ah makes sense


[07-Aug-21 03:32 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh those are all cute throwbacks now


[07-Aug-21 03:32 AM] king of cats#9205
i think the last muscial i saw was carrie


[07-Aug-21 03:33 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh wait i saw hamilton last year but it was from home so idk if that counts lol


[07-Aug-21 03:33 AM] king of cats#9205
ohhh hamilton is fun


[07-Aug-21 03:33 AM] king of cats#9205
i don't remember if i did


[07-Aug-21 03:33 AM] king of cats#9205
but i was looking forward to the in the heights film


[07-Aug-21 03:33 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i just know it was free on disney + for a bit and my sister had my friends account lmao


[07-Aug-21 03:34 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh that one sounds familiar i think my school did it and my friend was a part of it


[07-Aug-21 03:34 AM] king of cats#9205
did you ever have a gymnastics phase?


[07-Aug-21 03:34 AM] king of cats#9205
now that i think of it, maybe my first musical was sound of music


[07-Aug-21 03:34 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
omg i did gymnastics in prek i think lmao


[07-Aug-21 03:34 AM] king of cats#9205
ahahah sameeeeeeeeeee


[07-Aug-21 03:34 AM] king of cats#9205
and then i stopped


[07-Aug-21 03:35 AM] king of cats#9205
but i really wanted to do a handstand, so i taught myself


[07-Aug-21 03:35 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
started dance around that time tho and that was what i stuck with but i did have a few phases throughout where i wanted to do gymnastics things


[07-Aug-21 03:35 AM] king of cats#9205
i swear everyone did back in those days


[07-Aug-21 03:35 AM] king of cats#9205
ahahah


[07-Aug-21 03:35 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh sound of music has nice songs at least the ones i know lol


[07-Aug-21 03:35 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i still can‚Äôt handstand


[07-Aug-21 03:35 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i‚Äôm WEAK


[07-Aug-21 03:35 AM] king of cats#9205
i did ballet i think idk


[07-Aug-21 03:35 AM] king of cats#9205
i don''t remember


[07-Aug-21 03:35 AM] king of cats#9205
i can still do it, but it's best when you're in a pool


[07-Aug-21 03:35 AM] king of cats#9205
soo much easier


[07-Aug-21 03:36 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i did ballet til 7th i think then technically did it in hs but not rly


[07-Aug-21 03:36 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh i‚Äôve never tried in a pool


[07-Aug-21 03:36 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i don‚Äôt like water tbh i can‚Äôt even breathe easily when i‚Äôm standing in a pool lolll


[07-Aug-21 03:36 AM] king of cats#9205
ohhh


[07-Aug-21 03:37 AM] king of cats#9205
that actually makes sense


[07-Aug-21 03:37 AM] king of cats#9205
you could also do it against a wall


[07-Aug-21 03:37 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i can see how handstand would be easier but like id prob choke on water LOL


[07-Aug-21 03:37 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh yes i used to do that but my arms would give out too soon hehe


[07-Aug-21 03:37 AM] king of cats#9205
i honestly went through trial and error to do it


[07-Aug-21 03:38 AM] king of cats#9205
but i also did basketball as a sport


[07-Aug-21 03:38 AM] king of cats#9205
soooooooooo


[07-Aug-21 03:38 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i guess i didn‚Äôt care much about handstands bc i wanted to be flexible and do tricks more lmao


[07-Aug-21 03:38 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh sports not my thing but tbh basketball was an ok unit in pe loll


[07-Aug-21 03:38 AM] king of cats#9205
i can't say if sports were really my thing


[07-Aug-21 03:38 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
tho i‚Äôve barely scored any baskets in my life


[07-Aug-21 03:38 AM] king of cats#9205
i just did them


[07-Aug-21 03:38 AM] king of cats#9205
same


[07-Aug-21 03:39 AM] king of cats#9205
i was only good at guarding


[07-Aug-21 03:39 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
dance was my only athletic thing ever til that one year of track ew


[07-Aug-21 03:39 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
yeah i can‚Äôt do that either but ehhh whatwver LOL


[07-Aug-21 03:39 AM] king of cats#9205
i just didn't like doing offensive stuff


[07-Aug-21 03:39 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
not gonna play bball in the future or anything


[07-Aug-21 03:40 AM] king of cats#9205
honestly if i actually focused on cross country, my stamina would probably be better smh


[07-Aug-21 03:40 AM] king of cats#9205
i think by the end of the season was when my stamina was just beginning to get good


[07-Aug-21 03:40 AM] king of cats#9205
and then the season ended ahahahah


[07-Aug-21 03:40 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
but that‚Äôs the hard part :‚Äô) idk how people have the motivation i wish i could


[07-Aug-21 03:40 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ahhhh yeah


[07-Aug-21 03:40 AM] king of cats#9205
i don't even know how i convinced myself to run 2 miles


[07-Aug-21 03:40 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
once an xc friend tricked me into running 3 MILES i thought i was gonna die


[07-Aug-21 03:41 AM] king of cats#9205
and the worst part was i had a friend who was shouting at me to run faster ahahah


[07-Aug-21 03:41 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
1 is my max bc it‚Äôs required in pe smh


[07-Aug-21 03:41 AM] king of cats#9205
honestly 1 mile is so nice


[07-Aug-21 03:41 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh no that pressure when you‚Äôre alrd dying trying to pace yourself


[07-Aug-21 03:41 AM] king of cats#9205
pfft i would actually slow down


[07-Aug-21 03:41 AM] king of cats#9205
just to spite him ahahah


[07-Aug-21 03:41 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i disagree 1 lap is more than enough LOL i did sprints in t&f bc i wanted to hurdle


[07-Aug-21 03:41 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
good solution üòå


[07-Aug-21 03:42 AM] king of cats#9205
oml the 400 m as a track event is so hardddddddddd


[07-Aug-21 03:42 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
AGREED


[07-Aug-21 03:42 AM] king of cats#9205
i still remember doing training


[07-Aug-21 03:42 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i literally never did it before but my first meet, they signed everyone up for the 400

i'd have to do those weird things where you sprint 50 m and walk 50 m or something and go up by increments of 50 or something


[07-Aug-21 03:42 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i basically died


[07-Aug-21 03:42 AM] king of cats#9205
i ran a 3200 once


[07-Aug-21 03:42 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ohh yeah i think we did that


[07-Aug-21 03:42 AM] king of cats#9205

[07-Aug-21 03:42 AM] king of cats#9205
i did pretty good in 400


[07-Aug-21 03:43 AM] king of cats#9205
and then i quit


[07-Aug-21 03:43 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
after the first meet i never did the 409 again even tho i was supposed to lmao


[07-Aug-21 03:43 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i did horrendous in literally everything but jumps and hurdles


[07-Aug-21 03:43 AM] king of cats#9205
honestly lining up gives me anxiety


[07-Aug-21 03:43 AM] king of cats#9205
i just get all freaked out being in line and stuff


[07-Aug-21 03:43 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
WHCIH WERE THE REASON I WANTD TO JOIN but didn‚Äôt think i‚Äôd need to just run for 95% of practice


[07-Aug-21 03:43 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
YES


[07-Aug-21 03:43 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
and the gun scared me lol i have slow reflexes too


[07-Aug-21 03:44 AM] king of cats#9205
oh yeah, track definitely is like RUN RUN RUN


[07-Aug-21 03:44 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i joined with friends who also just wanted to do jumping events but they quit i forgot why


[07-Aug-21 03:44 AM] king of cats#9205
i used to just watch people get smoked


[07-Aug-21 03:44 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
and i was left there not realizing jumping is for sprinters who only run during practice and have to stay extra to do other stuff lmao


[07-Aug-21 03:44 AM] king of cats#9205
like one of the soccer players was in track and he would outsprint practically everyone in the 100m


[07-Aug-21 03:45 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ok but it‚Äôs sometimes interesting to wat h fast ppl


[07-Aug-21 03:45 AM] king of cats#9205

that‚Äôs hilarious


[07-Aug-21 12:55 PM] king of cats#9205
you know what i find really weird about spotify, and yes it‚Äôs really random


[07-Aug-21 12:56 PM] king of cats#9205
i set my language as english but it will still give me ads in spanish sometimes even though i don‚Äôt really understand spanish at all


[07-Aug-21 12:56 PM] king of cats#9205
sure i took three years of spanish, but i also didn‚Äôt really understand it lmao


[07-Aug-21 12:56 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
have you googled spanish stuff lmaoo


[07-Aug-21 12:56 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
cant relate i have premium üòå


[07-Aug-21 12:57 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
though i do wonder what type of ads i would get


[07-Aug-21 12:57 PM] king of cats#9205
i don‚Äôt do anything in spanish at all lmao


[07-Aug-21 12:57 PM] king of cats#9205
the last time i googled spanish was for google translate


[07-Aug-21 12:58 PM] king of cats#9205
my spanish 3 teacher really thought i knew how to write essays but none of us learned how to in spanish 2


[07-Aug-21 12:58 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
maybe they think you wanna learn spanish that way but like i don‚Äôt even know how ad algorithm works


[07-Aug-21 12:58 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ah sounds like chinese the first time we had to write essays too


[07-Aug-21 12:58 PM] king of cats#9205
lmaooo idk how the ad algorithms work either


[07-Aug-21 12:59 PM] king of cats#9205
youtube likes to give me men‚Äôs deodorant ads lmfao


[07-Aug-21 12:59 PM] king of cats#9205
i swear every foreign language teacher assumes you can write essays at a certain point


[07-Aug-21 01:00 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i used to either get the strangest or the most accurate ads it was kinda strange but now i use adblock lol


[07-Aug-21 01:01 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
YEAH i think they just think that since you know how to write in english, you can just put that to your other lang skills


[07-Aug-21 01:01 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
also i‚Äôm on the car and getting kinda carsick so ttyl lmao

[07-Aug-21 06:12 PM] king of cats#9205

[07-Aug-21 06:13 PM] king of cats#9205
especially if you haven‚Äôt been walking much


[07-Aug-21 06:13 PM] king of cats#9205

[07-Aug-21 06:13 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678

[07-Aug-21 06:15 PM] king of cats#9205
lmaooo


[07-Aug-21 06:15 PM] king of cats#9205
i feel like it‚Äôs such a hassle going outside


[07-Aug-21 06:16 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
it really is... i know it‚Äôs good for me and all that but


[07-Aug-21 06:16 PM] king of cats#9205
my parents are like wear a mask, wipe your hands every time you get back to the car, wash them when you get home, wipe everything you buy


[07-Aug-21 06:16 PM] king of cats#9205
i felt that sooooo hard


[07-Aug-21 06:16 PM] king of cats#9205
i swear my doctor is secretly thinking that this is exactly why i have a vitamin d deficiency


[07-Aug-21 06:17 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ohhh yeah i think for the first year my mom religiously wiped everything but i think now we‚Äôre just like whatever it should be alright


[07-Aug-21 06:17 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh üò≠ i started taking d3 pills ever since i went to the doc a few weeks ago LOL


[07-Aug-21 06:18 PM] king of cats#9205
i was supposed to start taking them way back in 6th grade after i went to my doctor about wrist pain


[07-Aug-21 06:18 PM] king of cats#9205
i had to get examined pretty thoroughly cause she was convinced i either had arthritis or carpal tunnel


[07-Aug-21 06:18 PM] king of cats#9205
but then they did bloodwork ig and i had a vitamin d deficiency


[07-Aug-21 06:19 PM] king of cats#9205
ofc i constantly forget to take the pills lmfao


[07-Aug-21 06:19 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh my it was that bad :// lol i keep forgetting as well


[07-Aug-21 06:19 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
tbh i should take all the vitamins uhh i think i‚Äôm deficient in everything healthy


[07-Aug-21 06:19 PM] king of cats#9205
well she prescribed painkillers that didn‚Äôt work soooooo i guess that was why she thought that?


[07-Aug-21 06:20 PM] king of cats#9205
m e


[07-Aug-21 06:20 PM] king of cats#9205
i have like two i have to take daily


[07-Aug-21 06:20 PM] king of cats#9205
and one of them is like an inch long


[07-Aug-21 06:20 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
why did the painkillers already not work oh no i thought those were supposed to gradually stop working


[07-Aug-21 06:20 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
sounds so funnn i‚Äôve never been prescribed anything long term before


[07-Aug-21 06:21 PM] king of cats#9205
i have no idea honestly


[07-Aug-21 06:21 PM] king of cats#9205
i guess it was cause it wasn‚Äôt something painkillers could help with??? idk but it got better because of the vitamin d supplements lmao


[07-Aug-21 06:22 PM] king of cats#9205
i‚Äôm gonna have to take two giant bottles of supplements with me and my melatonin ahaha


[07-Aug-21 06:22 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh i kinda forgot what d even helps with... was it bone strength? i guess thatd make sense


[07-Aug-21 06:22 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ah melatonin


[07-Aug-21 06:23 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i keep stopping myself from taking it even though multiple people have told me to lol


[07-Aug-21 06:23 PM] king of cats#9205
my parents bought it for me after a psychiatrist said to i think, or something


[07-Aug-21 06:23 PM] king of cats#9205
it‚Äôs nice when i messed up my sleep schedule and need to brute force fix it


[07-Aug-21 06:24 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh yeah that‚Äôs true it can stop your sleep from getting worse and worse and worse


[07-Aug-21 06:24 PM] king of cats#9205
which is exactly what i need to do today


[07-Aug-21 06:24 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i guess i‚Äôm saving it for when i really need it so that it‚Äôll actually work on me lolll


[07-Aug-21 06:24 PM] king of cats#9205
i went out, came home and napped soooo i just woke up a few minutes agoo


[07-Aug-21 06:25 PM] king of cats#9205
yeah don‚Äôt overtake


[07-Aug-21 06:25 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh love that i took a short nap in the car earlier


[07-Aug-21 06:25 PM] king of cats#9205
i knew someone who took a bunch of high dosage melatonin and at some point it just stopped working


[07-Aug-21 06:26 PM] king of cats#9205
so def be careful about taking too much cause the stronger sleep meds are illegal here i think or at the very least, extremely difficult to obtain


[07-Aug-21 06:26 PM] king of cats#9205
at least from what i‚Äôve heard


[07-Aug-21 06:26 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh i wouldn‚Äôt be surprised yeah


[07-Aug-21 06:27 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i also don‚Äôt wanna be reliant on it so i assume it‚Äôll be a once in a while thing (but idk i have no idea how it‚Äôs like so i don‚Äôt wanna get addicted LOL)


[07-Aug-21 06:27 PM] king of cats#9205
oh it‚Äôs weird as heck when it kicks in


[07-Aug-21 06:28 PM] king of cats#9205
it kinda feels like when you‚Äôre sick and you took medicine and you‚Äôre slowly getting increasingly tired


[07-Aug-21 06:28 PM] king of cats#9205
and then you‚Äôre guaranteed around 5 hours i think


[07-Aug-21 06:28 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh wow


[07-Aug-21 06:28 PM] king of cats#9205
but it‚Äôs not like it instantly kicks in


[07-Aug-21 06:29 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
all i remember is that once i was sick and i took nyquil to help slepe and instead i woke up like 1-2 hrs later and got even more sick smh


[07-Aug-21 06:29 PM] king of cats#9205
ahhhhh being sick sucksssss


[07-Aug-21 06:29 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ah it‚Äôs like a delayed thing


[07-Aug-21 06:29 PM] king of cats#9205
another reason why i don‚Äôt go outside


[07-Aug-21 06:29 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
yeah i literally woke up and RAN to the bathroom it was not fun


[07-Aug-21 06:30 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
yeah omg i also kinda skipped allergy season because i didn‚Äôt go outside


[07-Aug-21 06:30 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i didn‚Äôt have those 3 months of sneezing


[07-Aug-21 06:30 PM] king of cats#9205
i really skipped getting sick all of my senior year and i was soooo happy


[07-Aug-21 06:30 PM] king of cats#9205
especially when i got to skip flu season i was overjoyed :3


[07-Aug-21 06:31 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678

[07-Aug-21 06:31 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678

[07-Aug-21 07:25 PM] king of cats#9205

[07-Aug-21 07:25 PM] king of cats#9205
so needless to say, i'm trying to get it together and not do that through all of college ahahah


[07-Aug-21 07:27 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
see i tell myself i‚Äôm gonna improve in college but who knows what‚Äôll actually happen


[07-Aug-21 07:28 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i don‚Äôt even count doing a small-ish assignment the day before procrastinating tho LOL especially since i‚Äôve kinda looked at it and thought about it


[07-Aug-21 07:29 PM] king of cats#9205
i procrastinated on a whap shower curtain and ended up ruining a decent jacket over it


[07-Aug-21 07:29 PM] king of cats#9205
so i'm trying not to have a repeat of that in college


[07-Aug-21 07:29 PM] king of cats#9205
i just realized i also semi-slept through the star wars unit of my whap class and some of my english classes before


[07-Aug-21 07:33 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
shower curtain???


[07-Aug-21 07:34 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
and star wars? that seems so strange in whap lmaoo i didn‚Äôt take that class but my friends only had boring old history stuff


[07-Aug-21 07:44 PM] king of cats#9205
did no one else take whap and have to do a giant shower curtain?


[07-Aug-21 07:44 PM] king of cats#9205
as for star wars, my teacher had us watch it to learn how to write the long essays questions and the saqs


[07-Aug-21 07:45 PM] king of cats#9205
apparently it had all the proper components for a response that would get you a good score


[07-Aug-21 07:46 PM] king of cats#9205
but i really just kinda slept through part of the star wars thing


[07-Aug-21 07:46 PM] king of cats#9205
although my teacher was a *huge* star wars fan, as in he had boba fett tattooed on his arm


[07-Aug-21 07:47 PM] king of cats#9205
so maybe he just chose star wars cause he liked it a bunch ahahah

{Reactions}
üòÜ 

[07-Aug-21 07:50 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh that‚Äôs interesting i guess it‚Äôs a good way to get some ppl engaged lol


[07-Aug-21 07:50 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
uh maybe but i‚Äôve never heard a word about it and it sounds so out of place üò©


[07-Aug-21 07:50 PM] king of cats#9205
honestly though i can understand star wars being unique


[07-Aug-21 07:50 PM] king of cats#9205
but i swear it wasn't just me who had to do the giant shower curtain thing


[07-Aug-21 07:51 PM] king of cats#9205
i had to go out and buy a giant shower curtain in like april or may to use it for the project


[07-Aug-21 07:51 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i don‚Äôt rly like star wars oops i fell asleep when i tried to watch once


[07-Aug-21 07:51 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
lmaoo maybe it‚Äôs a more common thing but it just sounds so strange


[07-Aug-21 07:52 PM] king of cats#9205
and then i kinda procrastinated until like 11 pm and stayed up until 5 am doing the project and at some point i absentmindedly messed up and one of my sleeves turned pitch black and my arm got stained too


[07-Aug-21 07:52 PM] king of cats#9205
all because i rested my arm on an uncapped black sharpie


[07-Aug-21 07:52 PM] king of cats#9205
ofc i finished the giant shower curtain and managed to turn it in just fine and got a decent grade on it


[07-Aug-21 07:52 PM] king of cats#9205
but i ruined a decent jacket over it


[07-Aug-21 07:52 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh no omg sharpies are impossible


[07-Aug-21 07:53 PM] king of cats#9205
yeah and the jacket was my basketball one :p


[07-Aug-21 07:53 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ah yes the skill of finishing things before the deadline no matter what


[07-Aug-21 07:53 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
aww


[07-Aug-21 07:53 PM] king of cats#9205
thank goodness my season was over or i'd have to explain the giant black stain of sharpie that wouldn't come out


[07-Aug-21 07:53 PM] king of cats#9205
y e s


[07-Aug-21 07:54 PM] king of cats#9205
i used to hear my english teachers in high school tell people not to procrastinate on the essays


[07-Aug-21 07:54 PM] king of cats#9205
and then there was me who also put it off and took like 4-5 hours to write one essay and turn it in


[07-Aug-21 07:54 PM] king of cats#9205
i don't know if they actually knew i was doing the essay last minute or not though


[07-Aug-21 08:05 PM] king of cats#9205
jennyyyyyyyyyy, how's the event?


[07-Aug-21 08:20 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
LOL that would be so awkward


[07-Aug-21 08:20 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ok every teacher ever tho


[07-Aug-21 08:20 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
they all remind us not to but we still do hehe


[07-Aug-21 08:20 PM] king of cats#9205
riiiiiight?


[07-Aug-21 08:20 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i feel like some teachers know not even bc of the quality but by how you act or if you talk to ppl about it


[07-Aug-21 08:20 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
also i convinced my mom to let me leave :)))) she had no objection tho she didnt wanna be there either


[07-Aug-21 08:21 PM] king of cats#9205
that's niceeeee :3


[07-Aug-21 08:21 PM] king of cats#9205
also lowkey, i think my teachers know cause i turn things in at such odd hours


[07-Aug-21 08:21 PM] king of cats#9205
it'll be four am and my essay will just be submitted


[07-Aug-21 08:21 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh true my chem teacher never let me off after i think i emailed him a question at 2-3 am


[07-Aug-21 08:21 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oopsies


[07-Aug-21 08:21 PM] king of cats#9205
i have a trick for that


[07-Aug-21 08:21 PM] king of cats#9205
i just preset my send


[07-Aug-21 08:22 PM] king of cats#9205
i'll have emails sending at 8 am when i'm fast asleep ahahah


[07-Aug-21 08:22 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh YES i would start doing that now but i think it wasnt a thing back then or i didnt rly care


[07-Aug-21 08:22 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i used to submit a lot of stuff at 6-7 so they might just think i woke up early üòå


[07-Aug-21 08:22 PM] king of cats#9205
ahahahah


[07-Aug-21 08:23 PM] king of cats#9205
i usually have things in at weird times since i actually feel motivated for whatever reason at weird hours


[07-Aug-21 08:23 PM] king of cats#9205
i think that by the end of high school, my teachers just kinda stopped asking questions about why in the world i was up at like 2 am


[07-Aug-21 08:23 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh for sure i dont work efficiently until i have time pressure


[07-Aug-21 08:24 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
sometimes i try to start early but i know it takes me a lot longer if i dont have the deadline in front of my face lmao


[07-Aug-21 08:24 PM] king of cats#9205
that's why i liked timed essays so muchhhhhhhhhh


[07-Aug-21 08:24 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
yeah i think they all got used to it


[07-Aug-21 08:24 PM] king of cats#9205
i seriously can't think of anything to write when i'm trying to write an essay early usually


[07-Aug-21 08:24 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i would say same but i also just hate essays LOL i'd much rather have timed tho so they have lower expectations


[07-Aug-21 08:24 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
IKR


[07-Aug-21 08:24 PM] king of cats#9205
i have an unimaginable amount of run on sentences


[07-Aug-21 08:24 PM] king of cats#9205
it's not even a joke


[07-Aug-21 08:25 PM] king of cats#9205
i try really hard not to, but it happens so muchhhhh


[07-Aug-21 08:25 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
but tbh sometimes idk what to write during a timed one either... like once in lang i think i sat there for 15 min with a blank paper then decided to bs it


[07-Aug-21 08:25 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
OH SAME


[07-Aug-21 08:25 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
well it happens more when im rambling


[07-Aug-21 08:25 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
like my long blocks of msgs that have 0 punctuation


[07-Aug-21 08:25 PM] king of cats#9205
oml i try not to let my sentences get too long


[07-Aug-21 08:25 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i think in essays i at least use ,cc or make it somehow grammatically correct but just long and wordy


[07-Aug-21 08:26 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
*try is the key word for me but i usually fail lolll


[07-Aug-21 08:26 PM] king of cats#9205
but i got into a bad habit of writing exceedingly long sentences with no real idea of when i should stop the sentence


[07-Aug-21 08:26 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
yeah! and its also strange to separate into short sentences sometimes


[07-Aug-21 08:26 PM] king of cats#9205
i used to get in so much trouble for having like 10 different run ons


[07-Aug-21 08:26 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
it just sounds so robotic to me idk how to explain it


[07-Aug-21 08:26 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i definitely had comments about that lol


[07-Aug-21 08:27 PM] king of cats#9205
i don't get how anyone writes essays without run ons


[07-Aug-21 08:27 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
yeah sometimes the ideas come while youre writing and it all relates so i wanna keep it in one sentence! but some ppl just know what theyre saying beforehand so it sounds good lol


[07-Aug-21 08:27 PM] king of cats#9205
that is so true


[07-Aug-21 08:28 PM] king of cats#9205
but also when i usually write, it's not for schoolwork so i created a bunch of really really really bad habits


[07-Aug-21 08:28 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oo do you do creative writing


[07-Aug-21 08:28 PM] king of cats#9205
yessssssss


[07-Aug-21 08:28 PM] king of cats#9205
what about youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu


[07-Aug-21 08:28 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
woooo im definitely not creative enough to write so nopee


[07-Aug-21 08:29 PM] king of cats#9205
lmao do you have any other hobbies? :3


[07-Aug-21 08:29 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
but one of my freidns does and she wrote a lord of the flies fanfic with our freidns in it and i think its about 200 google doc pages AHAFHJSFHSJDB


[07-Aug-21 08:29 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
im kinda boring i dont do anything anymore


[07-Aug-21 08:29 PM] king of cats#9205
oml i could neverrrrrrrrrrr


[07-Aug-21 08:29 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i used to dance and sing hehe but since quarantine i havent rly done either


[07-Aug-21 08:29 PM] king of cats#9205
ohhhhhhh that's so cool


[07-Aug-21 08:30 PM] king of cats#9205
there's this stage apparently near 6th that does karaoke?


[07-Aug-21 08:30 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i would sit around bored thinking of things to do but not actually doing it... then 2021 started and i finally started watching shows to pass time but thats not rly productive


[07-Aug-21 08:30 PM] king of cats#9205
or maybe i just don't remember which college correctly ahahah


[07-Aug-21 08:30 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
:o


[07-Aug-21 08:30 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
but


[07-Aug-21 08:30 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i also am too scared of people to sing in front of others LOL


[07-Aug-21 08:30 PM] king of cats#9205
i think i've only ever written 150 ish pages


[07-Aug-21 08:30 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
thats still crazy


[07-Aug-21 08:30 PM] king of cats#9205
but i have hit 200 pages compiling recipes i found interesting


[07-Aug-21 08:31 PM] king of cats#9205
i think cookbooks are one of the faster ways to have an insane amount of pages


[07-Aug-21 08:31 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh wow i keep on wanting to learn to cook but i dont really know what the heck we have at home so i also just give up oops


[07-Aug-21 08:31 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
thats very true


[07-Aug-21 08:31 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ingredient lists can take up a lot of space lmao


[07-Aug-21 08:31 PM] king of cats#9205
honestly, i don't know how to cook, i just follow the instructions


[07-Aug-21 08:31 PM] king of cats#9205
it works out just fine


[07-Aug-21 08:32 PM] king of cats#9205
wait jennyyyyyyyyyyy


[07-Aug-21 08:32 PM] king of cats#9205

[07-Aug-21 08:33 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
:o i never watched but theyd run in the background lmao


[07-Aug-21 08:33 PM] king of cats#9205
i would just be like "HURRY UP AND GET TOGETHER, IT'S SO OBVIOUS YOU TWO WILL DATE"


[07-Aug-21 08:33 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
AHAHAHA most romcoms are all the same and cliche now


[07-Aug-21 08:34 PM] king of cats#9205
fr fr


[07-Aug-21 08:34 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i havent rly been watching much these past 2 months tho


[07-Aug-21 08:34 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678

[07-Aug-21 08:34 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
or can i


[07-Aug-21 08:34 PM] king of cats#9205
n o


[07-Aug-21 08:35 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
eh i should probably be more socially involved instead of watching something i dont even feel like watching sometimes üò© litearlly some shows were for the sake of wasting a day away


[07-Aug-21 08:35 PM] king of cats#9205
i felt that


[07-Aug-21 08:35 PM] king of cats#9205
honestly i'm kinda surprised no one has joined us yetttttttttt


[07-Aug-21 08:36 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i guess no one checks this server randomly lolll


[07-Aug-21 08:36 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh yeah do you think youre gonna join any clubs?


[07-Aug-21 08:36 PM] king of cats#9205
honestly i have no idea


[07-Aug-21 08:36 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
felt that so hard


[07-Aug-21 08:36 PM] king of cats#9205
i mean there are so manyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy


[07-Aug-21 08:37 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ikr ! seems overwhelming tbh


[07-Aug-21 08:37 PM] king of cats#9205
it's like high school clubs x 100 i swear


[07-Aug-21 08:37 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
but my sister was like "youd BETTER go to the club tables and go to events and stuff etc etc"


[07-Aug-21 08:37 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ikr i tried to go to some but i went once and dipped oops-


[07-Aug-21 08:37 PM] king of cats#9205
let's be real, i didn't join any clubs in high school


[07-Aug-21 08:37 PM] king of cats#9205
i didn't join any clubs at the community college i was at either


[07-Aug-21 08:38 PM] king of cats#9205
i don't think clubs were as important as people thought they were


[07-Aug-21 08:38 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i "joined" a few but i cant actually name a single one that i went to and knew what was happening in


[07-Aug-21 08:38 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
mhm unless you were an owner or had a position AND it was actually somewhat influential


[07-Aug-21 08:38 PM] king of cats#9205
my honors bio teacher had an anime club that i occasionally crashed


[07-Aug-21 08:39 PM] king of cats#9205
i remember she liked one piece


[07-Aug-21 08:39 PM] king of cats#9205
oh i have a horror story about a club leader


[07-Aug-21 08:39 PM] king of cats#9205
it's not like horror horror


[07-Aug-21 08:39 PM] king of cats#9205
but man it sucked


[07-Aug-21 08:39 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
:oo oh no what happeend


[07-Aug-21 08:40 PM] king of cats#9205
so this kid was a freshman in my chem honors class cause he apparently took a bio class at harker summer before school started and he made a science club which he claimed would be amazing


[07-Aug-21 08:40 PM] king of cats#9205
ofc i ended up joining cause i was interested and he said he wanted to be a cardiothoracic surgeon and i thought perhaps there would be dissections and fun things


[07-Aug-21 08:40 PM] king of cats#9205
instead, i found out we were studying


[07-Aug-21 08:41 PM] king of cats#9205
yes, *studying*


[07-Aug-21 08:41 PM] king of cats#9205
and it wasn't like the normal stuff we learn in high school, we were studying for the national science bowl for whatever reason


[07-Aug-21 08:41 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
LOL WHAT


[07-Aug-21 08:41 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
not the horror i was expecting but still horror nevertheless ü•¥


[07-Aug-21 08:41 PM] king of cats#9205
and the most "fun" thing he did was a project where people made ovens out of old pizza boxes and tinfoil which is something you can do as a child


[07-Aug-21 08:41 PM] king of cats#9205
the national science bowl stuff is the horror


[07-Aug-21 08:41 PM] king of cats#9205
it lives in my nightmares


[07-Aug-21 08:42 PM] king of cats#9205
everything there was so abstract and weird


[07-Aug-21 08:42 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
strange science project lol


[07-Aug-21 08:42 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
wow you actually kept going to the club after finding out what it was about??


[07-Aug-21 08:42 PM] king of cats#9205
nope


[07-Aug-21 08:42 PM] king of cats#9205
i ditched shortly afterwards despite him trying to get me stay for a bit


[07-Aug-21 08:43 PM] king of cats#9205
ig it had something to do with me being decent at chem + bio but like no way was i going to study some weird abstract stuff when our team was weaksauce


[07-Aug-21 08:43 PM] king of cats#9205
they spent a few months and then went to competition and then lost within the first round


[07-Aug-21 08:43 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oof rip him but yeah i wouldnt stay if it ended up being so different


[07-Aug-21 08:43 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
welppp not really a surprise ig


[07-Aug-21 08:44 PM] king of cats#9205
apparently the club is still around


[07-Aug-21 08:44 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh ! did they improve at all


[07-Aug-21 08:44 PM] king of cats#9205
that i don't know


[07-Aug-21 08:45 PM] king of cats#9205
i highly doubt they went too far in the competition though


[07-Aug-21 08:45 PM] king of cats#9205
there were a lot of other school within our bracket that could easily beat them out


[07-Aug-21 08:46 PM] king of cats#9205
the only two extracurriculars at my school that were clubs and actually good at what they did would be mock trial and robotics


[07-Aug-21 08:46 PM] king of cats#9205
in my sophomore year the school's mock trial went to state, i think


[07-Aug-21 08:46 PM] king of cats#9205
and robotics went to worlds in texas


[07-Aug-21 08:46 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
the only two extracurriculars at my school that were clubs and actually good at what they did would be mock trial and robotics
ohh yeah our school didnt have actual good academic clubs bc the math or quizbowl or whatverver didnt really end up working out


[07-Aug-21 08:46 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
o hey thats pretty impressive


[07-Aug-21 08:47 PM] king of cats#9205
i think the only other club i can remember being relatively remarkable was the math & physics tutoring club


[07-Aug-21 08:47 PM] king of cats#9205
but yeah, most of the clubs at my school were random though i think we had an esports club


[07-Aug-21 08:47 PM] king of cats#9205
and we had a nintendo club for one year


[07-Aug-21 08:48 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh wow people have the weirdest things


[07-Aug-21 08:48 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
omg


[07-Aug-21 08:48 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i think one year some dudes made a kendama club


[07-Aug-21 08:48 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
do you even remember those things :')))


[07-Aug-21 08:48 PM] king of cats#9205
oml thoseeee


[07-Aug-21 08:48 PM] king of cats#9205
weren't they popular in elementary school?


[07-Aug-21 08:48 PM] king of cats#9205
that was sooooo long ago i swear


[07-Aug-21 08:49 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
for us i think it was a 7th grade phase

the only really interesting that happened during my elementary school days was i had a bunch of overnight trips starting in 3rd grade


[07-Aug-21 08:50 PM] king of cats#9205
so i can safely say i've been to a farm and smelled what farm smells like


[07-Aug-21 08:50 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
farms dont smell too good yuck


[07-Aug-21 08:50 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i dont remember my field trips


[07-Aug-21 08:51 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
we used to go hiking a lot tho and i think rancho san antonio has a farm if you know what that is


[07-Aug-21 08:51 PM] king of cats#9205
i just remember my overnight trips cause i had two each year including my 6th grade


[07-Aug-21 08:51 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
sad moment when my child self was better at walking than me now


[07-Aug-21 08:51 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ooo nice i think i had overnight for science camp


[07-Aug-21 08:51 PM] king of cats#9205
i actually kinda know where that is


[07-Aug-21 08:51 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
and i also had school retreats so those were overnight


[07-Aug-21 08:51 PM] king of cats#9205
i used to have beach trips for three years straight


[07-Aug-21 08:52 PM] king of cats#9205
we'd camp somewhere and then go to the beach during the day


[07-Aug-21 08:52 PM] king of cats#9205
it was during the fall, around october-november i think when we'd go


[07-Aug-21 08:52 PM] king of cats#9205
so it was cold as heckkkkk


[07-Aug-21 08:52 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i do not like camping bc of the bugs lmao i get bitten so much


[07-Aug-21 08:52 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh yeah beach is fun on warm days


[07-Aug-21 08:52 PM] king of cats#9205
omg i hate camping for that same reason


[07-Aug-21 08:52 PM] king of cats#9205
i remember my 4th grade trip was gold country so we went to somewhere in norcal


[07-Aug-21 08:53 PM] king of cats#9205
no wait


[07-Aug-21 08:53 PM] king of cats#9205
that was my 5th grade 2nd overnight


[07-Aug-21 08:53 PM] king of cats#9205
my fourth grade's non-beach trip was the one where we went to mendocino


[07-Aug-21 08:53 PM] king of cats#9205
and the car ride suckedddddddddddd


[07-Aug-21 08:53 PM] king of cats#9205
i think everyone got slightly carsick


[07-Aug-21 08:53 PM] king of cats#9205
and we lived in cabins in the woods and there were bugs


[07-Aug-21 08:53 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ahhh yeah i used to get super carsick so it was bad


[07-Aug-21 08:53 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678

[07-Aug-21 08:53 PM] king of cats#9205
and i saw a banana slug and screamed


[07-Aug-21 08:53 PM] king of cats#9205
ahahah


[07-Aug-21 08:54 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
omg people used to lick those things


[07-Aug-21 08:54 PM] king of cats#9205
and kiss them


[07-Aug-21 08:54 PM] king of cats#9205
and i'd just stare at them grossed out


[07-Aug-21 08:54 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
if i expect to see one, they dont rly creep me out too much but theyre still so strange


[07-Aug-21 08:54 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
its so nasty


[07-Aug-21 08:54 PM] king of cats#9205
and there were also creeks and people would really play in them even though there were water skeeters on the water


[07-Aug-21 08:54 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
YUCK


[07-Aug-21 08:54 PM] king of cats#9205
my hatred for banana slugs is exactly why i couldn't attend ucsc ahahah


[07-Aug-21 08:55 PM] king of cats#9205
although it wasn't as bad as the invitation i got last year from  a school whose mascot was a spider


[07-Aug-21 08:55 PM] king of cats#9205
and they really said they thought they could see me as a spider i-


[07-Aug-21 08:55 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
LMAO ive been there a lot because i had a camp tehere every year


[07-Aug-21 08:55 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678

[07-Aug-21 08:59 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678

[07-Aug-21 09:00 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678

[07-Aug-21 09:00 PM] king of cats#9205

and i usually stop talking to them after a while which is sad


[07-Aug-21 09:03 PM] king of cats#9205
buuuut i don't think that's gonna happen with my guild because i really don't stop talking


[07-Aug-21 09:03 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
yeahhh that happens for me with so many people and i dont even know why it always ends up being that way


[07-Aug-21 09:03 PM] king of cats#9205
time zones really mess things up though


[07-Aug-21 09:03 PM] king of cats#9205
cause some of my friends are in se asia or something


[07-Aug-21 09:03 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oo nice :)) it always sucks to drift away


[07-Aug-21 09:03 PM] king of cats#9205
fr f r


[07-Aug-21 09:04 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh yeah thats yet another reason i stay up late... bc some of them are only online then


[07-Aug-21 09:04 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i basically live in taiwan timezone a lot of the time during summer LOL thats the excuse i use when my parents find me awake when they wake up


[07-Aug-21 09:05 PM] king of cats#9205
my mom always tells me my time is upside down in chinese


[07-Aug-21 09:05 PM] king of cats#9205
and like honestly, yeah


[07-Aug-21 09:05 PM] king of cats#9205
i do tend to have my times flipped


[07-Aug-21 09:05 PM] king of cats#9205
i have a friend in taiwan but i also don't talk to her much ahahah


[07-Aug-21 09:05 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ahahah just gettin ready to go on vacay to asia :))


[07-Aug-21 09:06 PM] king of cats#9205
oml yesssssssssssss


[07-Aug-21 09:06 PM] king of cats#9205
i wanna go to japan


[07-Aug-21 09:06 PM] king of cats#9205
everything looks so pretty there


[07-Aug-21 09:06 PM] king of cats#9205
especially the food


[07-Aug-21 09:06 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ah yeah i dont think i actively talk to anyone who lives there


[07-Aug-21 09:06 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
YES SAME


[07-Aug-21 09:06 PM] king of cats#9205
honestly now i have an actual reason to be up at odd hours since some of my friends from my guild like haikyuu and they're in a diff timezone


[07-Aug-21 09:06 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
but it would be so hard to figure out stuff especially if i got lost or something lol


[07-Aug-21 09:07 PM] king of cats#9205
fr fr


[07-Aug-21 09:07 PM] king of cats#9205
which is exactly why i should learn some japanese


[07-Aug-21 09:07 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
timezones are always so annyoing but also a good excuse :)


[07-Aug-21 09:07 PM] king of cats#9205
y e s


[07-Aug-21 09:07 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
have you picked up any japanese from animes?


[07-Aug-21 09:08 PM] king of cats#9205
i picked up more japanese from the japanese medical tv show i watch than i do from animes, oddly enough


[07-Aug-21 09:08 PM] king of cats#9205
whenever i watch animes i usually just end up remembering what the subs say, not the actual japanese lmfao


[07-Aug-21 09:08 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh i think reality/variety shows are usually better for learning because people speak more casually


[07-Aug-21 09:09 PM] king of cats#9205
definitely


[07-Aug-21 09:09 PM] king of cats#9205
especially since haikyuu has some dialects


[07-Aug-21 09:09 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
thats me w kdramas lolll sometimes i basically end up reading it as a novel with a blur of movement in the back


[07-Aug-21 09:09 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh rly?


[07-Aug-21 09:09 PM] king of cats#9205
like the miya twins speak in i think the kansai dialect


[07-Aug-21 09:09 PM] king of cats#9205
so they kinda speak a bit different


[07-Aug-21 09:10 PM] king of cats#9205
i picked up a bit of korean from binging an idol competition or something


[07-Aug-21 09:10 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
TIL that japanese has dialects ahaahah im not surprised but i never realized


[07-Aug-21 09:10 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh what show? i think i only know produce c ampfor k-tv shows


[07-Aug-21 09:10 PM] king of cats#9205
although i knew how to say good morning cause i had a teacher in elementary school who liked to have people do good mornings in different languages so everyone learned something new ig


[07-Aug-21 09:10 PM] king of cats#9205
i watched the unit, not produce 101 lmao


[07-Aug-21 09:11 PM] king of cats#9205
i don't know how i got into it, but i ended up hooked


[07-Aug-21 09:11 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh thats fun!


[07-Aug-21 09:11 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
never heard of that show lol but its always amazing to find something so random that you end up loving


[07-Aug-21 09:11 PM] king of cats#9205
yesssssssssssss


[07-Aug-21 09:12 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678

[07-Aug-21 09:12 PM] king of cats#9205
lmaooooooo


[07-Aug-21 09:12 PM] king of cats#9205
i feel like sometimes you don't mean to enjoy something as much as you do


[07-Aug-21 09:12 PM] king of cats#9205
but then when you find out it's just hard to stop


[07-Aug-21 09:13 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
yesshhs and yay more ruined sleep LOL


[07-Aug-21 09:13 PM] king of cats#9205

[07-Aug-21 09:13 PM] king of cats#9205

[07-Aug-21 09:13 PM] king of cats#9205

[07-Aug-21 09:18 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678

yeah they really do


[07-Aug-21 09:18 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678

[07-Aug-21 09:18 PM] king of cats#9205
some of them are soooo long


[07-Aug-21 09:18 PM] king of cats#9205
it was like 4-5 hours of streaming  i think


[07-Aug-21 09:18 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i used to binge watch streams on 2x after the vods were posted


[07-Aug-21 09:18 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
it was bad


[07-Aug-21 09:18 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678

[07-Aug-21 09:19 PM] king of cats#9205

[07-Aug-21 09:19 PM] king of cats#9205
mine was such a disaster


[07-Aug-21 09:19 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i really didnt start common app til 2021


[07-Aug-21 09:19 PM] king of cats#9205
i honestly just read manga instead of writing my supps


[07-Aug-21 09:19 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ignore that my first commonapp deadline was on either the 1st or 2nd


[07-Aug-21 09:19 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ah that was me with streams lol


[07-Aug-21 09:19 PM] king of cats#9205
omllllllllll that's wild


[07-Aug-21 09:19 PM] king of cats#9205
i don't even know how i survived last year


[07-Aug-21 09:20 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
im such a bad influence lol some 22 kilds asked me about apps and i was like DONT DO WHAT I DID


[07-Aug-21 09:20 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
me too tbh


[07-Aug-21 09:20 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i didnt think enough about college to care too much about apps and thats why on the day the uc was due, i was frantically looking for any major to put in lol


[07-Aug-21 09:20 PM] king of cats#9205
ahahah my mom is the one who handles the questions


[07-Aug-21 09:20 PM] king of cats#9205
but i also wasn't close with any of my underclassmen so no one asks me about stuff like that


[07-Aug-21 09:21 PM] king of cats#9205
the only app essays i'll be looking at are my other childhood friend's essays, maybe and that's cause he's the son of my mom's bestie from high school


[07-Aug-21 09:22 PM] king of cats#9205
at least for this season


[07-Aug-21 09:22 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ah yeah im not rly close with any but a few in my classes asked


[07-Aug-21 09:22 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i highly doubt ill read over anyones apps


[07-Aug-21 09:22 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i had no clue what i was doing myself


[07-Aug-21 09:22 PM] king of cats#9205
i read so many  fanfics that i know what bad storytelling sounds like


[07-Aug-21 09:23 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh i used to read fanfics i had a phase but many just had horrendous grammar


[07-Aug-21 09:23 PM] king of cats#9205
i spent my last year of high school reading manga and fanfics


[07-Aug-21 09:23 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
the only thing i can ado is grammar lol not the actual content


[07-Aug-21 09:23 PM] king of cats#9205
i think it depends on the fandom really, the quality is all over the place


[07-Aug-21 09:23 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
true true


[07-Aug-21 09:23 PM] king of cats#9205
content is the only thing i can actually help with


[07-Aug-21 09:23 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
also some are written by literal kids who dont know what theyre doign and its kinda cringe lmao


[07-Aug-21 09:23 PM] king of cats#9205
yessssssssssss

i will say that tags really cull the herd, that and how they summarize


[07-Aug-21 09:24 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
content is more important tho like you could alwasy get grammarly to check grammar but not content lol


[07-Aug-21 09:24 PM] king of cats#9205
usually you can tell how experienced an author is from the way they summarize, tag and other stuff


[07-Aug-21 09:25 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh yeah


[07-Aug-21 09:25 PM] king of cats#9205
the ones who write on tumblr as well as ao3 tend to have better content from what i've noticed


[07-Aug-21 09:25 PM] king of cats#9205
i've also noticed a bunch of wattpad writers tend to like those weird looking fonts


[07-Aug-21 09:25 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
lol kinda hypocritical but if they dont bother to capitalize or punctuate i automatically think itll be bad


[07-Aug-21 09:25 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh i litearlly havent been on tumblr i dont get how it works


[07-Aug-21 09:25 PM] king of cats#9205
honestly i have seen some decent all lowercase fics


[07-Aug-21 09:26 PM] king of cats#9205
i don't usually go on tumblr either ahahah


[07-Aug-21 09:26 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i didnt even know wattpad had fonts but i havent been on in years


[07-Aug-21 09:26 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i think it got really annoying to use


[07-Aug-21 09:26 PM] king of cats#9205
i mean they don't


[07-Aug-21 09:26 PM] king of cats#9205
somehow they have these html copy paste ones


[07-Aug-21 09:26 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
true i think ive read some but it really depends on how they summarize or how the first part is


[07-Aug-21 09:26 PM] king of cats#9205
yessssssssssssssss


[07-Aug-21 09:26 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh hmm id ont think ive noticed that?? kinda forgot tbh


[07-Aug-21 09:27 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678

[07-Aug-21 09:27 PM] king of cats#9205
oml sameeeeeeee


[07-Aug-21 09:28 PM] king of cats#9205
i gotta wrap that up


[07-Aug-21 09:28 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i know i left the parts i thought were harder


[07-Aug-21 09:28 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
so hopefully it isnt too bad but


[07-Aug-21 09:29 PM] king of cats#9205
i mean


[07-Aug-21 09:29 PM] king of cats#9205
it's not graded lmaooooooo


[07-Aug-21 09:29 PM] king of cats#9205
i'm just going to answer with whatever comes out of my brain


[07-Aug-21 09:34 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ok true im very glad it isnt because tbh my descriptions sound very wonky and nonacademic LOL


[07-Aug-21 09:34 PM] king of cats#9205
ngl i'm approaching it the same way i approach essays


[07-Aug-21 09:35 PM] king of cats#9205
i just write without too much thought and usually things make lots of sense


[07-Aug-21 09:35 PM] king of cats#9205
now i'm kinda curious, are you the type of person who plans out an essay or one who just writes one without any planning or outlining?


[07-Aug-21 09:35 PM] king of cats#9205
actually if anyone else wants to answer this question, please do


[07-Aug-21 09:37 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i usually just write because planning takes me too much time and id rather use that time writing lmaoo


[07-Aug-21 09:37 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
maybe my brain can subconsciously think while im writing the intro para and if it isnt thinking well, at least i can rest my hand while thinking instead of writing consecutively


[07-Aug-21 09:38 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
also when i plan i change it half the time anyways


[07-Aug-21 09:38 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
is anyone else here :((((


[07-Aug-21 09:46 PM] king of cats#9205
yeah!!! is anyone else here??? ;w;


[07-Aug-21 09:47 PM] king of cats#9205
s a m e
my brain does it fine as i'm working through the essay and it sounds so much more cohesive than it would if i was trying to hit all the points i planned out


[07-Aug-21 09:50 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
exactly! well at least i think thats how it works for me


[07-Aug-21 09:51 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
also random q uhh do you have the file from niema's lecture? the one where he wrote out some stuff related to this assignemnt


[07-Aug-21 09:51 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i have it but my laptop cant open it and i wanted to use it as reference:/


[07-Aug-21 09:54 PM] king of cats#9205
did you mean the aps discussion yesterday? if so i didn't download any files, i just wrote down what was relevant to the questions and that was it lmao


[07-Aug-21 09:56 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ahh i remember he sent whatever he wrote on the whiteboard in chat but the file type (1a) is so strange


[07-Aug-21 09:56 PM] king of cats#9205
yeah sometimes you end up needing some weird thing to open files


[07-Aug-21 09:56 PM] king of cats#9205
i also noticed sometimes the files end up downloaded or uploaded as weird files


[07-Aug-21 09:57 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i litearlly just tried downloading a file viewer but it failed lmao


[07-Aug-21 09:57 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
mhm i usually would screenshot but i forgot to figure out how to do this on my new laptop ü§°


[07-Aug-21 09:57 PM] king of cats#9205
the only stuff i have written down is that chart he drew of the 33 coin problem


[07-Aug-21 09:58 PM] king of cats#9205
oml i had to set up snagit on this laptop since it's new
the one i was going to buy still hasn't been released yet so this is my interim laptop ahahah


[07-Aug-21 09:58 PM] king of cats#9205
i mean i also have the stuff he said about 1b + 1c


[07-Aug-21 10:00 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
OH i just googled smth that helped but unfortunately it isnt what i expected it to be so the actual file was usless lmaooo


[07-Aug-21 10:00 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
yeah i just got this lpaotp too and im used to mac controls since our school laptops were macbooks


[07-Aug-21 10:01 PM] king of cats#9205
yeah the windows computers have this built in screenshotter known as snipping tool


[07-Aug-21 10:01 PM] king of cats#9205
but i find it kinda tiring to use since i don't think it has a hotkey


[07-Aug-21 10:01 PM] king of cats#9205
so i had my dad download snagit since it lets me set a hotkey


[07-Aug-21 10:02 PM] king of cats#9205
so were you able to open the file or do you want me to share a pic of the notes i took lmao


[07-Aug-21 10:03 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ohh nice


[07-Aug-21 10:04 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678

[07-Aug-21 10:05 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
mhm but now since ive forgotten math, i forgot how to write functions :')


[07-Aug-21 10:05 PM] king of cats#9205
functions like math functions


[07-Aug-21 10:05 PM] king of cats#9205
or functions like programming functions


[07-Aug-21 10:06 PM] king of cats#9205
i still kinda remember math functions


[07-Aug-21 10:11 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh yeah i mean math functions right now like how we need to write an equation as a function of *n* lmao


[07-Aug-21 10:13 PM] king of cats#9205
do we actually?


[07-Aug-21 10:13 PM] king of cats#9205

[07-Aug-21 11:49 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678

[07-Aug-21 11:49 PM] king of cats#9205
lewis capaldi


[07-Aug-21 11:50 PM] king of cats#9205

[07-Aug-21 11:50 PM] king of cats#9205

[07-Aug-21 11:50 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678

[07-Aug-21 11:50 PM] king of cats#9205

[07-Aug-21 11:51 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678

[07-Aug-21 11:51 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i think the only unreleased songs i can think of are miss you and something about cutting your hair idr üò©


[07-Aug-21 11:51 PM] king of cats#9205
but i only really keep up with corpse at this point lmfao


[07-Aug-21 11:51 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ahhhh yeah sometimes i download local files but theyre all gone now since new laptop


[07-Aug-21 11:52 PM] king of cats#9205
man new laptops are such a pain


[07-Aug-21 11:52 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i see i see but tbh many corpse songs are too intense for me


[07-Aug-21 11:52 PM] king of cats#9205
so glad my dad loaded all the important stuff of mine onto a hardrive


[07-Aug-21 11:52 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
fr!! but my school one was basically dead


[07-Aug-21 11:52 PM] king of cats#9205
that is so fairrrrrrrrrrr


[07-Aug-21 11:52 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
:oo i was too lazy to do that


[07-Aug-21 11:52 PM] king of cats#9205
lmao


[07-Aug-21 11:52 PM] king of cats#9205
but yeah i def get corpse being intense


[07-Aug-21 11:52 PM] king of cats#9205
i think his least intense song is probably agoraphobic


[07-Aug-21 11:53 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
mhm i rly like his voice but now i usually like softer songs


[07-Aug-21 11:53 PM] king of cats#9205
although he does have new stuff coming sometime


[07-Aug-21 11:53 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
yeahhh ive listened to that one a few  times


[07-Aug-21 11:53 PM] king of cats#9205
soft songs are so niceeeee


[07-Aug-21 11:53 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oo ok i like taking a listen in case theres smth i can vibe w lol


[07-Aug-21 11:53 PM] king of cats#9205
i think i found most of my soft songs from one of those remix youtube channels


[07-Aug-21 11:53 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
yes yes i think i realizd my fav genre is something i made up but wtv i call it melancholic ballads LOL


[07-Aug-21 11:54 PM] king of cats#9205
lmao ballads


[07-Aug-21 11:54 PM] king of cats#9205
i have this really random taste


[07-Aug-21 11:54 PM] king of cats#9205
at first it'll be k/da or something and then musicals and then sea shanties


[07-Aug-21 11:54 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
omg k/da lol


[07-Aug-21 11:55 PM] king of cats#9205
okay but if you're into like bass singers


[07-Aug-21 11:55 PM] king of cats#9205
i have a rec, he does covers on youtube


[07-Aug-21 11:55 PM] king of cats#9205
and his bass is quite nice


[07-Aug-21 11:55 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
yeah i think my taste is kinda random bc i do kinda listen all over the place


[07-Aug-21 11:55 PM] king of cats#9205
not like corpse deep


[07-Aug-21 11:55 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
:o who?

[07-Aug-21 11:56 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
but i dont usually find new music on youtube


[07-Aug-21 11:56 PM] king of cats#9205
i got a little too into sea shanties cause i was listening to reinaery


[07-Aug-21 11:56 PM] king of cats#9205
and then he showed up


[07-Aug-21 11:57 PM] king of cats#9205
i mean i learned a few on guitar years ago and wanted the nostalgia and then i got hooked to the bass


[07-Aug-21 11:57 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ive never heard of sea shanties lol


[07-Aug-21 11:57 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ohhh that makes sense


[07-Aug-21 11:58 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
omg i just searched it and drunken sailor is such a throwback that song makes me laugh


[07-Aug-21 11:58 PM] king of cats#9205
i swear that song reminds me of my 6th grade days


[07-Aug-21 11:59 PM] king of cats#9205

[07-Aug-21 11:59 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678

[08-Aug-21 12:00 AM] king of cats#9205

[08-Aug-21 12:00 AM] king of cats#9205

[08-Aug-21 12:00 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678

[08-Aug-21 12:00 AM] king of cats#9205

[08-Aug-21 12:00 AM] king of cats#9205
it's so weird thinking about how i willingly woke up early


[08-Aug-21 12:01 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
tbh i didnt know 1D til they disbanded bc so many classmates were dying during 7th grade about that band


[08-Aug-21 12:01 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
LOL fr i dont think i did it willingly tho


[08-Aug-21 12:01 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678

[08-Aug-21 12:01 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oo fun


[08-Aug-21 12:02 AM] king of cats#9205
omg i knew about 1D only cause we had to sing one of their songs and the daughter of the mom in charge of choir loved the band ig


[08-Aug-21 12:02 AM] king of cats#9205
which is how it ended up on our song lineup


[08-Aug-21 12:02 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
thats kinda funny lmaoo choir singing 1D would normally seems trange


[08-Aug-21 12:02 AM] king of cats#9205
we sang it during springtime or something


[08-Aug-21 12:03 AM] king of cats#9205
i think it was "that's what makes you beautiful"


[08-Aug-21 12:03 AM] king of cats#9205

[08-Aug-21 12:09 AM] king of cats#9205
:p


[08-Aug-21 12:09 AM] king of cats#9205
also like yeah, idk what it is with school and sketchy things lmfao


[08-Aug-21 12:09 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
me too and people are like... no you sleep in the morning


[08-Aug-21 12:09 AM] king of cats#9205
n o


[08-Aug-21 12:09 AM] king of cats#9205
it's always whenever you wakeup


[08-Aug-21 12:10 AM] king of cats#9205
cause it's morning somewhere else in the world aaaaaaaa


[08-Aug-21 12:10 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
yesssss because people dont rly call 12 am daytime so there isnt even a set thing anyways!


[08-Aug-21 12:10 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
LOL TRUE


[08-Aug-21 12:10 AM] king of cats#9205
jenny did you got to a public school or a private school?


[08-Aug-21 12:10 AM] king of cats#9205
i swear most people i know always shit on private schools lmfao


[08-Aug-21 12:11 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh i went to priv starting in 6th


[08-Aug-21 12:11 AM] king of cats#9205
oh wow that's pretty cool!!!


[08-Aug-21 12:11 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
tbh i just say tuition isnt worth but im not mad my family sent me there lol


[08-Aug-21 12:11 AM] king of cats#9205
i think it really depends on the school tbh


[08-Aug-21 12:11 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
the admin did many questionable things tbh but its not like publics were better


[08-Aug-21 12:12 AM] king of cats#9205
that's also a good point


[08-Aug-21 12:12 AM] king of cats#9205
like i remember people saying that harker was an academically strong private school


[08-Aug-21 12:12 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
so many ppl in our school hated it tho because i went to a chrisitan school and many staff are old white males who lean very right


[08-Aug-21 12:12 AM] king of cats#9205
ohhhhhhhhhhhh


[08-Aug-21 12:12 AM] king of cats#9205
that is indeed a very awkward thing


[08-Aug-21 12:12 AM] king of cats#9205
i had a friend who went a catholic school and was like "i learned almost no science"


[08-Aug-21 12:13 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
mhm mhm they pushed a lot of beliefs on people and there were a lot of controversial talks


[08-Aug-21 12:13 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ah yeah i think the biggest thing is evolution


[08-Aug-21 12:13 AM] king of cats#9205
yeah evolution is controversial, don't some states refuse to teach it?


[08-Aug-21 12:14 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
we wer etaught the diff perspectives but it wasnt like unscientific at the same time and most other stuff was normal i guess


[08-Aug-21 12:14 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh im not sure about that


[08-Aug-21 12:14 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
but our teacher basically taught it and leaned twd evolution lol but its not like we were graded on what we believed in


[08-Aug-21 12:14 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i know some teachers are like you better have my opinion or else you fail


[08-Aug-21 12:14 AM] king of cats#9205
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh i felt that


[08-Aug-21 12:15 AM] king of cats#9205
i've had teachers like that and they are so difficult


[08-Aug-21 12:15 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
yeahhh those teachers are irritating


[08-Aug-21 12:15 AM] king of cats#9205
i think i pissed off my 9th grade advisory teacher that way lmfao


[08-Aug-21 12:15 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
most of mine werent like that though which i thought was nice


[08-Aug-21 12:15 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oop


[08-Aug-21 12:15 AM] king of cats#9205
i don't feel sorry at all though


[08-Aug-21 12:16 AM] king of cats#9205
i think he was a bit backwards to begin with


[08-Aug-21 12:16 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i dont actually know what advisory teachers do but he probably deserved it üò©


[08-Aug-21 12:16 AM] king of cats#9205
he was just supposed to help us get oriented during the first month of school


[08-Aug-21 12:16 AM] king of cats#9205
and i may or may not have said some interesting things that made him speechless


[08-Aug-21 12:17 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh lmaoo did he not experience people who disagreed w him before or smth


[08-Aug-21 12:17 AM] king of cats#9205
well


[08-Aug-21 12:17 AM] king of cats#9205
i think it'll make more sense if i just say what happened


[08-Aug-21 12:19 AM] king of cats#9205
so he was talking about manners and stuff because i guess that's something he found really important and he was telling us about dating etiquette and i was like okay whatever
but my friend (the one who attended a catholic school & is going to u of t) and i were kinda just semi paying attention until he said something like "guys if a girl laughs at your jokes, it means they like you"
it was his fault for what happened afterwards cause he added a "right ladies?"
and i just lost it, i started laughing and he looked at me funny and asked if i had anything to say, and i said yeah sure i did 
and i told him "well, they could also feel bad for you"


[08-Aug-21 12:20 AM] king of cats#9205
yeah and he stared at me flabbergasted as my friend and i burst into another round of hysterical laughter


[08-Aug-21 12:20 AM] king of cats#9205
and we never saw him again since advisory ended that day


[08-Aug-21 12:21 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
LOL WHAT first of all thats a strange thing to say to a group of students but ok


[08-Aug-21 12:21 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
yes go tel him the facts and i love that he just disappeared afaeirgg


[08-Aug-21 12:21 AM] king of cats#9205
ahahahahah he didn't disappear


[08-Aug-21 12:22 AM] king of cats#9205
we just never had to see him again cause advisory was over


[08-Aug-21 12:22 AM] king of cats#9205
i think since that day he never liked me as a student again though i'd never know cause he wasn't my english teacher


[08-Aug-21 12:22 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ohhh well thats a nice last impression you made :D


[08-Aug-21 12:23 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ahahaha i feel like if you had him as a teacher he would just feel awkward seeing you


[08-Aug-21 12:23 AM] king of cats#9205
lmfao it's one of the few times when i regret nothing


[08-Aug-21 12:23 AM] king of cats#9205
he was backwards in that sense and honestly it was kinda weird


[08-Aug-21 12:23 AM] king of cats#9205
i don't think people have to laugh with you, sometimes they can laugh at you


[08-Aug-21 12:24 AM] king of cats#9205
so hearing that was just weirdly very funny


[08-Aug-21 12:24 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
mhm definitely i also just cringe hearing people give advice like that in the first place and i wish i could retort half the time


[08-Aug-21 12:24 AM] king of cats#9205
sometimes i do it without thinking


[08-Aug-21 12:25 AM] king of cats#9205
i mean in that situation i didn't have a choice cause everyone was staring lmfao


[08-Aug-21 12:25 AM] king of cats#9205
but still i think there are def times it's better to say nothing


[08-Aug-21 12:25 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i only have smart retorts if its w ppl im already pretty close with bc otherwise i probably wouldnt be talking


[08-Aug-21 12:25 AM] king of cats#9205
it takes so long to think of good ones


[08-Aug-21 12:25 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
lol i bet the other ppl there were glad you said that


[08-Aug-21 12:26 AM] king of cats#9205
perhaps lmfao


[08-Aug-21 12:26 AM] king of cats#9205
at the very least, it made for an interesting final advisory


[08-Aug-21 12:26 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ahhh yes sometimes i think of good ones a literal day later completely randomly


[08-Aug-21 12:26 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh definitely lol


[08-Aug-21 12:27 AM] king of cats#9205
i feel like since it takes so long to come up with retorts, i usually just end up saying exactly what i'm thinking


[08-Aug-21 12:27 AM] king of cats#9205
and then things like that happen


[08-Aug-21 12:27 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh i cant relate but sometimes i wish i did that lmaoo


[08-Aug-21 12:28 AM] king of cats#9205
i felt that


[08-Aug-21 12:28 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i think the few times i *tried* to say what i was thinking just ended up so awkward and i just wanna go hide in a hole


[08-Aug-21 12:28 AM] king of cats#9205
there are times i strongly regret not saying something and being like "ur wrong"


[08-Aug-21 12:28 AM] king of cats#9205
that's such a mood though


[08-Aug-21 12:28 AM] king of cats#9205
wanting to say something and then panicking and changing it midway through


[08-Aug-21 12:28 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh that happens to me way more but i think sometimes i just lose hope in ppl and just dont even try anymore if they say too many strange things that make no sense to me


[08-Aug-21 12:29 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
!!! exactly


[08-Aug-21 12:29 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
and half the time i say words that dont exist bc i combine 2 words-


[08-Aug-21 12:29 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
gotta work on talking tbh


[08-Aug-21 12:29 AM] king of cats#9205
i love making portmanteaus


[08-Aug-21 12:29 AM] king of cats#9205
not me misspelling big words like portmanteaus


[08-Aug-21 12:30 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ok i like when i do it on purpose but not when its just me messing up a basic skill lolll


[08-Aug-21 12:30 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
eh the meaning comes through anyways :))


[08-Aug-21 12:30 AM] king of cats#9205
talking is so hard sometimes i swearrrrrrrrrrrrrrr


[08-Aug-21 12:30 AM] king of cats#9205
t r u e


[08-Aug-21 12:30 AM] king of cats#9205
especially when you're trying to talk to someone for the first time????


[08-Aug-21 12:30 AM] king of cats#9205
like i get all anxious and panicky


[08-Aug-21 12:31 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
its so strange i can just ramble on sometimes but only for specific ppl and i dont know the criteria for it and for others i just make so many speaking-typos


[08-Aug-21 12:31 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
OH YEAH


[08-Aug-21 12:31 AM] king of cats#9205
omg speaking typos


[08-Aug-21 12:31 AM] king of cats#9205
ahah i'm probably gonna steal that ahahah


[08-Aug-21 12:31 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
it makes talking in person so awkward for me im just like weiearhgoaengbeigierg


[08-Aug-21 12:31 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ahahahah i was trying to make a portmanteau w it but nothing sounds right


[08-Aug-21 12:31 AM] king of cats#9205

ü§û yeahh i think i might like the quarter system because of my work habits but gotta actually experience it to know!


[08-Aug-21 03:10 PM] crossboy#7777
from my experience i super love the quarter system!


[08-Aug-21 03:10 PM] crossboy#7777
it's DEFINITELY a lot sometimes but for me it's super nice because i like being able to move through things and it always feels like there's something new to do, which is especially nice for those GEs that are annoying

[09-Aug-21 01:29 AM] king of cats#9205
i had a guy friend and people kept saying he liked me
i thought he didn't but it turns out he did cause i realized like three years later he kept trying to ask me out


[09-Aug-21 01:29 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652

theyre so cute ;-;


[09-Aug-21 01:08 PM] king of cats#9205
whenever i see cats or dogs i just feel really happy


[09-Aug-21 01:08 PM] crossboy#7777
same


[09-Aug-21 01:08 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
However the conservationalist in me gets sad vibes from the flat faces because of the health conditions and concerns based around it...


[09-Aug-21 01:08 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
literally! there are the cutest vids everywhere


[09-Aug-21 01:09 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh no are flat faces always bad for the cat?


[09-Aug-21 01:09 PM] king of cats#9205
i think it's kinda like the whole thing with bulldogs and it being hard to breathe


[09-Aug-21 01:10 PM] king of cats#9205
i remember people also said that munchkin cats with super stubby legs are concerning too


[09-Aug-21 01:10 PM] king of cats#9205
most purebred cats have issues cause well,,, inbreeding


[09-Aug-21 01:11 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
aw :( i dont actually see many animals irl so when i do i never really pay attention to that but ugh hope people will take care of their pets


[09-Aug-21 01:12 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
The issues are like, you wanna drink water as a dog or cat with a flat face you can drown. They tend to have more biological/genetic issues because of inbreeding and because their gene pool becomes weaker. It's just not good because the birth defects or health problems can make the animal miserable. xD


[09-Aug-21 01:12 PM] king of cats#9205
honestly i like mixed breeds more for that very reason


[09-Aug-21 01:13 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
It's just important to know these sorts of things if you want to adopt an animal or rescue an animal you know about possible health concerns and stuff.


[09-Aug-21 01:13 PM] king of cats#9205
plus they're actually v v v cute


[09-Aug-21 01:13 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
You know whats not cute?


[09-Aug-21 01:13 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
Trying to figure out your 4 year plan and then realizing that some of it needs to be changed because the advisor was like: that isnt allowed.

[09-Aug-21 01:15 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678

i didnt choose that bc i dont want more math classes LOL


[09-Aug-21 01:16 PM] king of cats#9205
i mean i did calc ab ;w;


[09-Aug-21 01:17 PM] alexavndra#4425
i did calc ab y but that's only cus i took accelerated precalc or whatever


[09-Aug-21 01:17 PM] king of cats#9205
i skipped precalc trig at my school b/c i could


[09-Aug-21 01:18 PM] alexavndra#4425
oh bet


[09-Aug-21 01:18 PM] king of cats#9205
our school had this weird setup where if we took a specific math class we could skip that part so i did


[09-Aug-21 01:18 PM] king of cats#9205
and i took precalc trig concurrent and remembered nothing


[09-Aug-21 01:18 PM] king of cats#9205
but calc a went just fine


[09-Aug-21 01:19 PM] alexavndra#4425
i think ours is like alg 1 > geo > alg 2 > precalc ??? but it depends where u start as a freshman


[09-Aug-21 01:19 PM] king of cats#9205
oh we were on the integrated math system so it went something like
integrated 1 > integrated 2> integrated 3/3STEM (if you did 3 stem you could skip)> integrated 4


[09-Aug-21 01:20 PM] alexavndra#4425
ooh what i've never heard of that fr


[09-Aug-21 02:28 PM] ferreti#0348
oh we had int 1 > int 2 > int 3 > precalc or calc


[09-Aug-21 02:28 PM] John._.#1301
lmao or the honors sequence


[09-Aug-21 02:29 PM] John._.#1301

{Reactions}

[09-Aug-21 02:32 PM] king of cats#9205
i feel like doing ab bc in a year is nice since you'd only need 1 ap test, the bc one


[09-Aug-21 03:35 PM] pain.#9573
Do any of the mentors here recommend Math 18 linear algebra or Math 31AH honors linear algebra. Just wanted to get some insight


[09-Aug-21 03:41 PM] crossboy#7777
The honors class is much more difficult from what I'm aware. I think in most cases you should consider the regular path, and only go towards the honors if you have a specific want to do so, rather than considering it as an alternative option


[09-Aug-21 03:42 PM] pain.#9573
Okay thanks Josh! I heard it was more theoretical and proof-y


[09-Aug-21 03:42 PM] pain.#9573
nasty stuff


[09-Aug-21 03:45 PM] crossboy#7777
Yup exactly, but it *also* covers all of the main content too, so it's significantly more work


[09-Aug-21 03:45 PM] crossboy#7777
No problem!


[09-Aug-21 05:52 PM] king of cats#9205

[10-Aug-21 04:59 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
tbh i thought most of their lives were too sad


[10-Aug-21 04:59 PM] king of cats#9205
yeah it's really old now that i think of it


[10-Aug-21 04:59 PM] king of cats#9205
fr they areeeeeeeee


[10-Aug-21 04:59 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
like what they had to go through early on doesnt really disappear bc they have a happily ever after üò©


[10-Aug-21 04:59 PM] king of cats#9205
oml that's my gripe with so many storiessssssss


[10-Aug-21 05:00 PM] king of cats#9205
like now that i'm older and life happened, you end up being like why did they just magically get better and how?


[10-Aug-21 05:00 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
exactly! and arent the original brothers grimm ones all really sad or something


[10-Aug-21 05:00 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
they gotta appease the children i guess


[10-Aug-21 05:00 PM] king of cats#9205
not just sad but also morbid af


[10-Aug-21 05:01 PM] alexavndra#4425
yeah gotta keep it pg


[10-Aug-21 05:01 PM] king of cats#9205
disney censorship


[10-Aug-21 05:01 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh yeah that would NOT do well with kids or their parents


[10-Aug-21 05:01 PM] king of cats#9205
if i remember right, the original grimm's brother tale the mermaid dies and becomes seafoam

ah the little mermaid grimm version


[10-Aug-21 05:03 PM] king of cats#9205
dead dove: do not eat is a tag people use for fanfiction and works that are pretty much as labeled to warn readers that all the tags on the work are indeed as dark as the author has indicated


[10-Aug-21 05:04 PM] king of cats#9205
it's kind of a read at your discretion tag


[10-Aug-21 05:04 PM] king of cats#9205
it was taken from a tv show i think


[10-Aug-21 05:04 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678

[10-Aug-21 05:05 PM] king of cats#9205
sometimes it makes you wonder though


[10-Aug-21 05:05 PM] king of cats#9205
like the chemical hazards signs, does everyone actually know how to read that stuff?


[10-Aug-21 05:05 PM] king of cats#9205
i mean  i had to for school


[10-Aug-21 05:06 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
eh- i just know those signs mean it's dangerous but not specfic meanings hehe


[10-Aug-21 05:06 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
should be alright if i avoid anyways? üò≥


[10-Aug-21 05:06 PM] king of cats#9205
yeah! the signs just specify what kind of dangers i think


[10-Aug-21 05:07 PM] alexavndra#4425
ooh okay


[10-Aug-21 05:07 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i just searched it and basically only know the toxic and fire ones


[10-Aug-21 05:07 PM] king of cats#9205
i forget all the dangers but i know i got tested on them for whatever reason


[10-Aug-21 05:07 PM] king of cats#9205
i think the point is, be careful


[10-Aug-21 05:08 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678

[10-Aug-21 05:08 PM] king of cats#9205

[10-Aug-21 05:13 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678

[10-Aug-21 05:13 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
omg i used to think that high beam was the best for everything before i took any practices


[10-Aug-21 05:13 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678

[10-Aug-21 07:01 PM] king of cats#9205

[10-Aug-21 07:01 PM] king of cats#9205
my brother's going to take that sometime


[10-Aug-21 07:01 PM] king of cats#9205
i did spanish for my foreign language


[10-Aug-21 07:01 PM] king of cats#9205
i thought it was easier cause i'm much better with my latin roots


[10-Aug-21 07:02 PM] Viridion#0234
perhaps i should have done that


[10-Aug-21 07:02 PM] king of cats#9205
perhaps, but i messed up when i didn't take ap spanish :p


[10-Aug-21 07:03 PM] king of cats#9205
i had to take the foreign lang placement but idk if i did okay 
my mom was like if you didn't do good, just take chinese and you'll be fine


[10-Aug-21 07:03 PM] Viridion#0234
ooof


[10-Aug-21 07:03 PM] king of cats#9205
i mean it'll probably be quite easy but yeah, sucks


[10-Aug-21 07:03 PM] king of cats#9205
i took 3 years of it to retake it potentially lmfao


[10-Aug-21 07:04 PM] king of cats#9205
wait ethan, can you speak taiwanese?


[10-Aug-21 07:04 PM] Viridion#0234
no lmao


[10-Aug-21 07:04 PM] Viridion#0234
only think i know how to say is "you are a fat pig"


[10-Aug-21 07:04 PM] king of cats#9205
lmfaoooooo


[10-Aug-21 07:06 PM] king of cats#9205
whatever i've learned is from my older relatives speaking in taiwanese to gossip b/c some of my family can't speak taiwanese 
although i've also had a relative speak full blown taiwanese at me and i understood almost nothing lmfao


[10-Aug-21 07:07 PM] Viridion#0234
LMAO


[10-Aug-21 07:07 PM] Viridion#0234
issa struggle üòî


[10-Aug-21 07:07 PM] king of cats#9205
fr relatives are, they always think you understand more than you actually do


[10-Aug-21 07:08 PM] king of cats#9205
hi again jenny!!!


[10-Aug-21 07:08 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i would type the taiwanese i know but i dont know how to translate to pinyin :')


[10-Aug-21 07:08 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
hellooo!


[10-Aug-21 07:08 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
just read through everything hehe


[10-Aug-21 07:08 PM] king of cats#9205
omg taiwanese is so hard to do pinyin for


[10-Aug-21 07:09 PM] king of cats#9205
i think there are more intonations or smth for it


[10-Aug-21 07:09 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
it reminds me of when people pinyin cantonese and i cant even possibly translate it


[10-Aug-21 07:09 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
yeahhhh


[10-Aug-21 07:09 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i tried googling it and i gave up


[10-Aug-21 07:09 PM] king of cats#9205
i think the only perk of taiwanese is that other forms of hokkien are kinda similar to some degree


[10-Aug-21 07:09 PM] king of cats#9205
well that and if half of your family isn't able to understand it, gossip


[10-Aug-21 07:09 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
mhm when i first found out that it was kinda the same as hokkien, i was shook


[10-Aug-21 07:10 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
:((((


[10-Aug-21 07:10 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
im the one they talk about


[10-Aug-21 07:10 PM] king of cats#9205
ahahah my family mainly speaks taiwanese but my mom's brothers both married ppl who can't so their kids don't


[10-Aug-21 07:10 PM] king of cats#9205
so my grandpa is always telling me to call him yeye idk if that pinyin is right


[10-Aug-21 07:10 PM] king of cats#9205
even though i call him ah-gong which is taiwanese


[10-Aug-21 07:10 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
they just never felt like teaching us


[10-Aug-21 07:11 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ohh


[10-Aug-21 07:11 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
wait i say both i never realized


[10-Aug-21 07:11 PM] king of cats#9205
oof i picked it up cause i was the only kid when i was born


[10-Aug-21 07:11 PM] king of cats#9205
my mom's side lived like in the area so they'd speak in taiwanese


[10-Aug-21 07:12 PM] king of cats#9205
i only learned that when i started going to chinese school and i told my teacher i liked my ah-mah and she was like wHaT?


[10-Aug-21 07:12 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ah makes sense, i cant pick up languages from hearing them easily because i just never understand it at all


[10-Aug-21 07:12 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh LOL


[10-Aug-21 07:12 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i also always forget the different names for every relative depending on their relation to you


[10-Aug-21 07:12 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
so i avoid mentioning anything but mama baba


[10-Aug-21 07:13 PM] king of cats#9205
omg i find it so frustrating when i have to explain who someone is relation to me in english


[10-Aug-21 07:13 PM] king of cats#9205
like my grandma's sister is my grandaunt in chinese but in english she's just my aunt or something???


[10-Aug-21 07:13 PM] king of cats#9205
it's really weird


[10-Aug-21 07:14 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
huh isnt that grandaunt?? i just dont kunderstand the removed cousin stuff


[10-Aug-21 07:14 PM] king of cats#9205
honestly don't know, apparently all the forms don't allow for that?


[10-Aug-21 07:14 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
that is so strange


[10-Aug-21 07:14 PM] king of cats#9205
right?


[10-Aug-21 07:14 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
im glad i dont have to explain my relations LOL


[10-Aug-21 07:15 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i always forget who my cousins are and who my aunts/uncles are bc half of them are 40+ :')


[10-Aug-21 07:15 PM] king of cats#9205
oh wow


[10-Aug-21 07:15 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
yeah both my parents are the youngest and they have large age gaps


[10-Aug-21 07:15 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
and they had me late


[10-Aug-21 07:15 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
so it added up


[10-Aug-21 07:15 PM] king of cats#9205
ohhh that's kinda wild


[10-Aug-21 07:16 PM] king of cats#9205
i don't know my cousins on my dad's side too well ngl


[10-Aug-21 07:16 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh and i mean large age gap with their siblings not each other ahaha


[10-Aug-21 07:16 PM] king of cats#9205

[10-Aug-21 07:16 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678

[10-Aug-21 07:16 PM] king of cats#9205

[10-Aug-21 07:19 PM] king of cats#9205

[10-Aug-21 07:19 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
:o yeah i dont know much about movies since i literally never watched anything in the past


[10-Aug-21 07:19 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i should really see the classics


[10-Aug-21 07:19 PM] king of cats#9205
i think my parents let me watch lord of the rings


[10-Aug-21 07:20 PM] king of cats#9205
i got hooked, read the books, and then ended up watching the hobbit trilogy when it came out


[10-Aug-21 07:20 PM] king of cats#9205
honestly the battle of five armies makes people cry


[10-Aug-21 07:21 PM] king of cats#9205
so there's a warning :3


[10-Aug-21 07:21 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh now i wanna see if i cry lol i used to never cry but sometimes the strangest things in movies will just break me


[10-Aug-21 07:21 PM] king of cats#9205
honestly i remember crying over raya


[10-Aug-21 07:22 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i think i always planned on reading lord of the rings but also never got around to that


[10-Aug-21 07:22 PM] king of cats#9205
ahahah


[10-Aug-21 07:22 PM] king of cats#9205
did you ever read eragon?


[10-Aug-21 07:22 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678

[10-Aug-21 07:22 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
hmm


[10-Aug-21 07:22 PM] king of cats#9205
yeah it was one of the newer ones!!!


[10-Aug-21 07:22 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i think ive only seen the eragon summary but the book cover looks very familiar


[10-Aug-21 07:23 PM] king of cats#9205
oh that's actually really fair


[10-Aug-21 07:23 PM] king of cats#9205
the series is *long*


[10-Aug-21 07:23 PM] king of cats#9205
in terms of page count


[10-Aug-21 07:23 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh thats something else i wanted to watch lmao i saw it on the plane but there wasnt enough time to finish it


[10-Aug-21 07:23 PM] king of cats#9205
the movie was different from the book, idr by how much


[10-Aug-21 07:23 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i think if i saw it in middle school i wouldve read it all because i literally read 24/7 ahahaha


[10-Aug-21 07:23 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
soo many movies and books are really different


[10-Aug-21 07:24 PM] king of cats#9205
okay this begs a very important question (i really hope other people answer too) 
what's a movie that made you cry?


[10-Aug-21 07:24 PM] king of cats#9205
artemis fowl will make you question what the heck disney is doing
the book and the movie are two different things entirely that only share one thing in common: the names of the characters


[10-Aug-21 07:25 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
what the heck i didnt know there was even a movie made for that but i just googled it and all the auto questions are like "why is artemis fowl so bad" lmaoo


[10-Aug-21 07:25 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
why can i literally not think of any right now even though i know a few exist!


[10-Aug-21 07:26 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
im planning on watching the notebook with friends this week tho so we'll see how that goes


[10-Aug-21 07:26 PM] king of cats#9205
y es


[10-Aug-21 07:26 PM] king of cats#9205
i don't think i ever watched it


[10-Aug-21 07:26 PM] king of cats#9205
but definitely, if it's good, say so


[10-Aug-21 07:26 PM] king of cats#9205
are most people only here for open lab hours?


[10-Aug-21 07:26 PM] king of cats#9205
is that why it's just you & me in chat?


[10-Aug-21 07:26 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
doesnt everyone love it though?


[10-Aug-21 07:26 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678

[10-Aug-21 07:27 PM] king of cats#9205

[10-Aug-21 07:27 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678

[10-Aug-21 07:41 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678

yeah idk what was going on with that


[10-Aug-21 07:43 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
thats strange but i guess i didnt know the difference for the longest time anyways so i wouldnt have realized lmaoo


[10-Aug-21 07:43 PM] king of cats#9205
cause some people i knew were chatting about the new suicide squad and saying it was funny that dc took the marvel director and marvel harley lmfao


[10-Aug-21 07:43 PM] alexavndra#4425

[10-Aug-21 07:51 PM] king of cats#9205

[10-Aug-21 11:47 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
You can!


[10-Aug-21 11:48 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
But it‚Äôs hard to draw animals


[10-Aug-21 11:48 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
Especially horses


[10-Aug-21 11:48 PM] king of cats#9205
it really is


[10-Aug-21 11:48 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
Idk why


[10-Aug-21 11:48 PM] king of cats#9205

[10-Aug-21 11:49 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
It‚Äôs like driver and navigator

We gotta switch


[10-Aug-21 11:50 PM] king of cats#9205

honestly i feel like i'd probably not be good at never have i ever


[10-Aug-21 11:59 PM] king of cats#9205
i've done a lot of pretty stupid things lmao


[11-Aug-21 12:01 AM] Viridion#0234
never have i ever is the best game for people with no life üòî


[11-Aug-21 12:02 AM] king of cats#9205
my brain just randomly went ‚Äúcards against humanity‚Äù


[11-Aug-21 12:02 AM] king of cats#9205
idk what it means but i played it once and it was interesting


[11-Aug-21 12:05 AM] king of cats#9205

[11-Aug-21 12:09 AM] Viridion#0234

[11-Aug-21 12:09 AM] Viridion#0234
cards against humanity is so much fun


[11-Aug-21 12:09 AM] king of cats#9205
i was so caught off guard b/c i didn't know what the cards were like


[11-Aug-21 12:10 AM] king of cats#9205
i mean it's high school?


[11-Aug-21 12:10 AM] Viridion#0234

[11-Aug-21 12:10 AM] Viridion#0234
quite nsfw


[11-Aug-21 12:10 AM] king of cats#9205

[11-Aug-21 12:10 AM] king of cats#9205

[11-Aug-21 12:11 AM] Viridion#0234

[11-Aug-21 12:11 AM] king of cats#9205

[11-Aug-21 12:15 AM] king of cats#9205

[11-Aug-21 12:15 AM] Viridion#0234

[11-Aug-21 12:21 AM] king of cats#9205

[11-Aug-21 12:21 AM] Viridion#0234
i can only run it pretty well bc i have a pretty new phone


[11-Aug-21 12:21 AM] king of cats#9205

[11-Aug-21 12:21 AM] Viridion#0234
ooh which character


[11-Aug-21 12:22 AM] king of cats#9205
lemme look in my chats with a diff friend i think i found the name


[11-Aug-21 12:22 AM] king of cats#9205
but she has like pastel purple hair


[11-Aug-21 12:22 AM] Viridion#0234
keqing?


[11-Aug-21 12:23 AM] king of cats#9205
yeah! her


[11-Aug-21 12:24 AM] king of cats#9205
idk why her of all characters


[11-Aug-21 12:25 AM] Viridion#0234
she has a pretty easy to replicate design


[11-Aug-21 12:25 AM] Viridion#0234
main thing is the fake cat ears with hair


[11-Aug-21 12:28 AM] king of cats#9205
ohhhh


[11-Aug-21 12:28 AM] king of cats#9205
well i'm still not gonna do it lmao


[11-Aug-21 12:28 AM] Viridion#0234
LMAO


[11-Aug-21 12:28 AM] king of cats#9205
i've had the experience of wearing fake ears


[11-Aug-21 12:28 AM] king of cats#9205

[11-Aug-21 12:28 AM] king of cats#9205
and i also had a tail to match lmfao


[11-Aug-21 12:28 AM] Viridion#0234
this is she, for reference


[11-Aug-21 12:29 AM] king of cats#9205
is she just stabbing the slime?


[11-Aug-21 12:29 AM] Viridion#0234
with a finger, yes


[11-Aug-21 12:29 AM] king of cats#9205
wow


[11-Aug-21 12:29 AM] Viridion#0234
....what were you coslpaying


[11-Aug-21 12:29 AM] king of cats#9205
nothing it's been my halloween costume many times


[11-Aug-21 12:29 AM] king of cats#9205
it was once my brother's costume for his what does the fox say that practically all the kids his age did back when the song was big


[11-Aug-21 12:30 AM] king of cats#9205
once i passed it off as a kitsune costume


[11-Aug-21 12:30 AM] king of cats#9205
the rest of the time it was just a low effort costume for fun


[11-Aug-21 12:30 AM] Viridion#0234
i see


[11-Aug-21 12:31 AM] Viridion#0234
if you dont mind me asking, why the objection to cosplaying as her


[11-Aug-21 12:32 AM] king of cats#9205
i don't know her as a character + no clue what her voice lines are


[11-Aug-21 12:32 AM] king of cats#9205
it would be awkward if someone saw me and she was their fave character


[11-Aug-21 12:36 AM] king of cats#9205
oh and then i'd get worried that someone would ask me about the game ahahah


[11-Aug-21 12:37 AM] king of cats#9205
@Viridion ^ :3


[11-Aug-21 12:37 AM] Viridion#0234
oh LMAO


[11-Aug-21 12:37 AM] Viridion#0234
yea thats reasonable


[11-Aug-21 12:39 AM] Viridion#0234
genshin is fun, but its also a lot


[11-Aug-21 12:40 AM] king of cats#9205

[11-Aug-21 12:47 AM] king of cats#9205
ohhhh that's interesting


[11-Aug-21 12:47 AM] king of cats#9205
i feel like he's one of those popular characters who has a bunch of fanfics


[11-Aug-21 12:47 AM] Viridion#0234
So the exclusivity adds to the allure


[11-Aug-21 12:47 AM] king of cats#9205
i know kaeya's also popular


[11-Aug-21 12:47 AM] Viridion#0234
He is, in fact


[11-Aug-21 12:47 AM] king of cats#9205

[11-Aug-21 12:49 AM] Viridion#0234
Of all the characters in Genshin, him???


[11-Aug-21 12:49 AM] Viridion#0234
Although the chest window probably added to it


[11-Aug-21 12:49 AM] king of cats#9205
kaeya seemed like one of those noveau ways of spelling kaya


[11-Aug-21 12:49 AM] Viridion#0234
Ok I can kinda see how you make that mistake


[11-Aug-21 12:49 AM] king of cats#9205
i thought maybe he was just flat???


[11-Aug-21 12:51 AM] Viridion#0234
LMAO


[11-Aug-21 12:51 AM] Viridion#0234
Ok I have to shower brb


[11-Aug-21 12:51 AM] king of cats#9205

i have a nice frame so it'll be fun


[11-Aug-21 01:08 AM] king of cats#9205
ahahah it can be one of those spot the difference games lmfao


[11-Aug-21 01:09 AM] king of cats#9205
unrelated but riot games really has life figured out


[11-Aug-21 01:10 AM] king of cats#9205
they started doing music and apparently now they're doing a show too?


[11-Aug-21 01:10 AM] king of cats#9205
meanwhile blizzard wow animatics are so nice


[11-Aug-21 01:11 AM] king of cats#9205
but they don't turn them into like actual movies


[11-Aug-21 01:11 AM] king of cats#9205
my 1 am complaints are weird as heck


[11-Aug-21 01:11 AM] Viridion#0234
Didn‚Äôt the wow movie suck balls


[11-Aug-21 01:11 AM] king of cats#9205
yeah apparently


[11-Aug-21 01:11 AM] king of cats#9205
but ngl cgi is not their strong suit imo


[11-Aug-21 01:11 AM] king of cats#9205
it's actually their trailers for the games that rock


[11-Aug-21 01:12 AM] Viridion#0234
Mhm


[11-Aug-21 01:12 AM] king of cats#9205
like the shadowlands patch for wow had some seriously great art and storytelling and voice acting


[11-Aug-21 01:12 AM] king of cats#9205
i think the game with the best cgi trailer i've seen would be the one made for diablo 4


[11-Aug-21 01:12 AM] Viridion#0234
Ah I wouldn‚Äôt nnow, never touched wow before


[11-Aug-21 01:12 AM] king of cats#9205
i don't play either game


[11-Aug-21 01:13 AM] king of cats#9205
i ended up getting into the rabbithole of wow lore after i accidentally came across one of the videos


[11-Aug-21 01:13 AM] king of cats#9205
my dad played wow ages ago and he still plays diablo


[11-Aug-21 01:13 AM] Viridion#0234
I remember watching and rewatching some of the old Star Wars game trailers


[11-Aug-21 01:13 AM] Viridion#0234
Those were cool


[11-Aug-21 01:13 AM] Viridion#0234
I did the same for league lmao


[11-Aug-21 01:13 AM] king of cats#9205
oml league


[11-Aug-21 01:14 AM] king of cats#9205
i think i only got interested b/c of k/da + the lead singer for this band that i liked did a song with them


[11-Aug-21 01:14 AM] king of cats#9205
and then someone showed me that they somehow made a holographic dragon appear in a stadium which i thought was cool


[11-Aug-21 01:14 AM] Viridion#0234
Damn that‚Äôs wild


[11-Aug-21 01:14 AM] king of cats#9205
but i had an ex who played league


[11-Aug-21 01:15 AM] Viridion#0234
Red flag üö©


[11-Aug-21 01:15 AM] king of cats#9205
ahahahahahah


[11-Aug-21 01:15 AM] king of cats#9205
what makes that a red flag?


[11-Aug-21 01:15 AM] Viridion#0234
Joking, it‚Äôs just fun to dunk on league


[11-Aug-21 01:15 AM] king of cats#9205
oml lmfao


[11-Aug-21 01:15 AM] Viridion#0234
I‚Äôve never actually tried it myself


[11-Aug-21 01:15 AM] king of cats#9205
my brother did and he complained about it


[11-Aug-21 01:16 AM] king of cats#9205
i don't remember what his complaint was


[11-Aug-21 01:16 AM] Viridion#0234
Everyone I know who plays or has played league hates it


[11-Aug-21 01:16 AM] king of cats#9205
wait then why do they still play?


[11-Aug-21 01:16 AM] Viridion#0234
It‚Äôs bizarre to me


[11-Aug-21 01:16 AM] Viridion#0234
Exactly!


[11-Aug-21 01:16 AM] king of cats#9205
okay but i kinda understand that sentiment


[11-Aug-21 01:17 AM] king of cats#9205
sometimes i really hate the games i play because i have to do so many events in a month


[11-Aug-21 01:17 AM] king of cats#9205
i guess it takes a real league player to explain how one can hate a game and still play it lmfao


[11-Aug-21 01:17 AM] Viridion#0234
I just don‚Äôt play games if I feel like it‚Äôs become a responsibility instead of for fun


[11-Aug-21 01:18 AM] king of cats#9205
lmaoooo i should do that


[11-Aug-21 01:18 AM] king of cats#9205
but it's hard to not play them ahsfklhsaf


[11-Aug-21 01:18 AM] Viridion#0234
Yea


[11-Aug-21 01:18 AM] Viridion#0234
The way I like to think of It is


[11-Aug-21 01:19 AM] Viridion#0234
If I‚Äôm playing just so I don‚Äôt fall behind on progression or advancement of some kind


[11-Aug-21 01:19 AM] Viridion#0234
And I don‚Äôt actually enjoy the process of playing it


[11-Aug-21 01:19 AM] Viridion#0234
Then I‚Äôm not going to enjoy it later on when I‚Äôve achieved whatever I‚Äôm currently doing in the game


[11-Aug-21 01:19 AM] Viridion#0234
Bc there will always be more things to do


[11-Aug-21 01:19 AM] king of cats#9205
ohhhhhhh


[11-Aug-21 01:19 AM] king of cats#9205
that makes sense


[11-Aug-21 01:20 AM] king of cats#9205
that just described animal crossing pocket camp

[11-Aug-21 01:20 AM] king of cats#9205
every month there's a new event with three parts


[11-Aug-21 01:20 AM] king of cats#9205
and every month i play it even though it's like a job


[11-Aug-21 01:20 AM] Viridion#0234
that is so sad


[11-Aug-21 01:20 AM] king of cats#9205
i tell myself i don't need every single stupid pixel furniture


[11-Aug-21 01:20 AM] Viridion#0234
Toxic relationship üò§


[11-Aug-21 01:20 AM] king of cats#9205
but then i come up with another reason to play


[11-Aug-21 01:21 AM] king of cats#9205
although a lot of my old friends stopped playing :3


[11-Aug-21 01:21 AM] Viridion#0234
Ahh


[11-Aug-21 01:21 AM] Viridion#0234
That was the case for me and Genshin for a while


[11-Aug-21 01:21 AM] Viridion#0234
I initially started playing bc all my friends were


[11-Aug-21 01:21 AM] Viridion#0234
But about two months after I started really getting into it, they lost interest


[11-Aug-21 01:22 AM] Viridion#0234
So I didn‚Äôt really know anyone playing for a few months


[11-Aug-21 01:22 AM] king of cats#9205
ohhh well all my friends were mainly adults who had lives outside of the game lmao


[11-Aug-21 01:22 AM] Viridion#0234
But I still enjoyed the game so I kept it up


[11-Aug-21 01:22 AM] Viridion#0234
And over the past few months, I got my other friends into it, so now I have even more reason to continue playing


[11-Aug-21 01:23 AM] Viridion#0234
Ahhh that makes sense


[11-Aug-21 01:23 AM] Viridion#0234
No sense in keeping up a job by playing a game when you have to keep up a job irl


[11-Aug-21 01:23 AM] king of cats#9205
lmfao yep


[11-Aug-21 01:25 AM] king of cats#9205
i honestly ask myself why i still stay up late sometimes


[11-Aug-21 01:26 AM] Viridion#0234
That revenge sleep procrastination or smth


[11-Aug-21 01:26 AM] king of cats#9205
lmfao


[11-Aug-21 01:26 AM] Viridion#0234
‚ÄúRevenge bedtime procrastination‚Äù describes the decision to sacrifice sleep for leisure time that is driven by a daily schedule lacking in free time.


[11-Aug-21 01:27 AM] king of cats#9205
out of curiosity, how is it that you never sleep much?


[11-Aug-21 01:27 AM] Viridion#0234
You know, I‚Äôm not quite sure


[11-Aug-21 01:27 AM] Viridion#0234
I think I average 6 hours?


[11-Aug-21 01:28 AM] Viridion#0234
I just like the vibes at night I guess


[11-Aug-21 01:28 AM] king of cats#9205
that's fair


[11-Aug-21 01:30 AM] Viridion#0234
Also I have piss-poor time management


[11-Aug-21 01:30 AM] king of cats#9205
oml sameeee


[11-Aug-21 01:31 AM] Viridion#0234
But it‚Äôs ok!


[11-Aug-21 01:31 AM] Viridion#0234
I still (mostly) function day-to-day


[11-Aug-21 01:32 AM] king of cats#9205
i-
i couldn't do that i'm already tired from 7 hours


[11-Aug-21 01:33 AM] Viridion#0234
It‚Äôs a skill developed over time


[11-Aug-21 01:34 AM] king of cats#9205
that's scary


[11-Aug-21 01:42 AM] ferreti#0348
yikes


[11-Aug-21 01:48 AM] Viridion#0234
I‚Äôve been trying to at least get 7 hours per day the past few weeks


[11-Aug-21 01:48 AM] Viridion#0234

[11-Aug-21 02:48 PM] king of cats#9205
honestly sometimes i use brute force to fix my sleep schedule


[11-Aug-21 02:49 PM] Viridion#0234
how does that work


[11-Aug-21 02:49 PM] alexavndra#4425
melatonin gummies?


[11-Aug-21 02:50 PM] Younus#8307
you get up REALLY early when you sleep late so that at the night you'll be so tired you have no choice but to fall asleep

[11-Aug-21 02:58 PM] alexavndra#4425
it works lemme tell you that


[11-Aug-21 02:58 PM] king of cats#9205
it works but if you overtake them they won't


[11-Aug-21 02:58 PM] alexavndra#4425
bro they make u feel like heavy if you overtake


[11-Aug-21 02:58 PM] king of cats#9205
and then you'll have to hunt for the stronger alternative that i think is much harder to find


[11-Aug-21 02:59 PM] king of cats#9205
i have never taken more than 1 ngl


[11-Aug-21 02:59 PM] alexavndra#4425
the one i take is two


[11-Aug-21 02:59 PM] king of cats#9205
but i know an insomniac who kept upping their dosage and now the melatonin does nothing

[11-Aug-21 03:00 PM] king of cats#9205
honestly i think the only other brute force method is to make yourself tired by aggressively messing up your sleep schedule


[11-Aug-21 03:00 PM] king of cats#9205
i did that once and actually went to bed on time for the first time


[11-Aug-21 03:00 PM] alexavndra#4425
that's what i did once


[11-Aug-21 03:00 PM] alexavndra#4425

i k r


[11-Aug-21 08:04 PM] king of cats#9205
omg pls be careful though
i scarred my cornea a few years ago and my optometrist is always like "the scar is still there"


[11-Aug-21 08:05 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh no what happened?


[11-Aug-21 08:05 PM] king of cats#9205
i honestly don't know, i just had a hard time taking them out one day and then i managed to injure my right eye :3


[11-Aug-21 08:06 PM] king of cats#9205
that's why you gotta be careful cause if it happens too many times/a lot of damage happens no more night time contacts


[11-Aug-21 08:06 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i‚Äôm also just not sure if their guidelines are just to get money from us because one of my friends has a lot more lenient optometrist and apparently he says everything is still fine with his contacts and eyes


[11-Aug-21 08:06 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ohhh yeah


[11-Aug-21 08:07 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
sometimes it kinda gets stuck on your eye and it hurts so bad to take it out then, but i usually check to make sure it‚Äôs loosened or else i‚Äôll use eye drops first


[11-Aug-21 08:07 PM] king of cats#9205
yeah it really gets difficult


[11-Aug-21 08:07 PM] king of cats#9205
i can't imagine how cosplay contacts feel, esp sclera ones


[11-Aug-21 08:07 PM] king of cats#9205
also @Viridion hi!!!! how has your day been?


[11-Aug-21 08:08 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678

[11-Aug-21 08:09 PM] king of cats#9205
i don't know how people do those contacts cause i swear it's hard plastic in your eye


[11-Aug-21 08:09 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678

[11-Aug-21 08:10 PM] king of cats#9205

[11-Aug-21 08:17 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
My day was good! I was happy we got a tour and got to see mentors. I liked meeting other groups and confusing people with singing then having an opera voice lesson.


[11-Aug-21 08:17 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
Socializing is 10/10 favorite

i want more friends to chat with ahahah


[11-Aug-21 08:18 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
I agree


[11-Aug-21 08:18 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
I feel like it‚Äôs mostly the girls hanging out and chatting


[11-Aug-21 08:18 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
I could be wrong though


[11-Aug-21 08:19 PM] king of cats#9205
yeah mostly girls


[11-Aug-21 08:19 PM] king of cats#9205
so far i think i've seen a handful of guys drop by but not many


[11-Aug-21 08:20 PM] king of cats#9205
i swear this chat doesn't bite and i can make a bunch of puns related to cats and animals on purpose if that sets anyone at ease lmfao


[11-Aug-21 08:20 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
You know what I want to code?


[11-Aug-21 08:20 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
A like UCSD map app kinda like Disneyland


[11-Aug-21 08:21 PM] king of cats#9205
oml that would be so helpful!!!!!!!!!!


[11-Aug-21 08:21 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
A nice cute thing where you can sort by like bathroom or gym or dining hall


[11-Aug-21 08:21 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
It would track where you are you know and show you the fastest path


[11-Aug-21 08:21 PM] king of cats#9205
yes and it would be great if it could get updates on wherever construction is


[11-Aug-21 08:22 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
Absolutely!


[11-Aug-21 08:22 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
That‚Äôs what I wanna code


[11-Aug-21 08:22 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
Idk how to


[11-Aug-21 08:22 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
Should I ask a mentor XD


[11-Aug-21 08:22 PM] king of cats#9205
i think you'd need a few things


[11-Aug-21 08:22 PM] king of cats#9205
but otherwise it's pretty do-able


[11-Aug-21 08:22 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
A map feature of some kind, a cute interface, and tracking as well as information‚Ä¶


[11-Aug-21 08:22 PM] king of cats#9205
yes


[11-Aug-21 08:23 PM] king of cats#9205
it would be like waze but ucsd only


[11-Aug-21 08:23 PM] loshy#1738
if you look up ‚Äúucsd map‚Äù there‚Äôs something kind of like that on the ucsd site


[11-Aug-21 08:23 PM] king of cats#9205
i think you might need a data set or take data from google maps lmfao


[11-Aug-21 08:23 PM] loshy#1738
not cute but it tries

[11-Aug-21 08:24 PM] king of cats#9205
omg that's cool


[11-Aug-21 08:24 PM] king of cats#9205

[11-Aug-21 08:25 PM] loshy#1738

[11-Aug-21 08:25 PM] king of cats#9205
i wish it was an app


[11-Aug-21 08:25 PM] lyd#9524

[11-Aug-21 08:25 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
Aww


[11-Aug-21 08:25 PM] king of cats#9205
but honestly having a living breathing person is 100x better than a map


[11-Aug-21 08:25 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
It‚Äôs nice but not cute enough


[11-Aug-21 08:25 PM] king of cats#9205

[11-Aug-21 08:27 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
You know where you are


[11-Aug-21 08:27 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
It tells you information


[11-Aug-21 08:27 PM] king of cats#9205
ohhhhh that actually seems nicer and easier to use


[11-Aug-21 08:27 PM] king of cats#9205

[11-Aug-21 08:27 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
Like the drop down window and stuff


[11-Aug-21 08:28 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
But instead its like buildings or stuff


[11-Aug-21 08:28 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
And like reviews maybe like Yelp on dining hall stuff


[11-Aug-21 08:28 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
I know for sure the app needs the map, it should have a drop down window, windows for where each thing with words are, and a search button


[11-Aug-21 08:29 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
Maybe it would also be beneficial to have notifications or something? So like a banner area to say: have a good day! Or good luck on finals! And then information like: there is construction!

Research competition then make it better so ours is most popular


[11-Aug-21 08:29 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
Then we have to make it more accessible for each different kind of user and we should create a business plan

[12-Aug-21 12:11 AM] king of cats#9205

[12-Aug-21 12:11 AM] king of cats#9205
and then i basked in regret as the messages came in and people thought i was interesting enough to message


[12-Aug-21 12:12 AM] lyd#9524
omg HAHA


[12-Aug-21 12:12 AM] lyd#9524

[12-Aug-21 12:14 AM] king of cats#9205

[12-Aug-21 12:14 AM] lyd#9524
SUGAR PARENT


[12-Aug-21 12:14 AM] king of cats#9205

[12-Aug-21 12:14 AM] king of cats#9205

[12-Aug-21 12:15 AM] lyd#9524
ahahah yess accurate


[12-Aug-21 12:17 AM] king of cats#9205
i think the most awkward convo i had was one where someone reached out to me about lore for middle earth despite only watching the movies


[12-Aug-21 12:17 AM] king of cats#9205
either way


[12-Aug-21 12:17 AM] king of cats#9205

[12-Aug-21 12:22 AM] king of cats#9205
that would make for an interesting question to pose


[12-Aug-21 12:22 AM] lyd#9524
true


[12-Aug-21 12:22 AM] king of cats#9205
okay but i like to think that i'm capable of talking to almost anyone so long as there's a shared language


[12-Aug-21 12:23 AM] king of cats#9205
oh and i can't be anxious either


[12-Aug-21 12:23 AM] lyd#9524

Hello friends


[12-Aug-21 12:23 AM] king of cats#9205

[12-Aug-21 12:24 AM] lyd#9524

[12-Aug-21 12:24 AM] king of cats#9205

[12-Aug-21 12:29 AM] king of cats#9205

[12-Aug-21 12:32 AM] king of cats#9205
hi jennyyyyy


[12-Aug-21 12:32 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678

[12-Aug-21 12:32 AM] king of cats#9205
also warning: i took a melatonin to ensure i go to bed sometime early so i might disappear


[12-Aug-21 12:33 AM] king of cats#9205
that's so interesting!!


[12-Aug-21 12:33 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
omg you always say hi when im typing how are you so quick üò©


[12-Aug-21 12:33 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
yeahh i noticed that i used my left hand for some strange things that i cant even name


[12-Aug-21 12:34 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
and in sports sometimes i was better when i used it lol my left arm is also stronger for a strange reason


[12-Aug-21 12:34 AM] king of cats#9205
i type a lot so i am very quick with my words


[12-Aug-21 12:34 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
but- i didnt even send a message yet!


[12-Aug-21 12:34 AM] king of cats#9205
i learned how to use a mouse and draw with one using my right hand but i do practically everything else with my left hand


[12-Aug-21 12:34 AM] king of cats#9205
i mean i could see you were typing :3


[12-Aug-21 12:35 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
you should get rest if you're tired :3 im sleepy as well because i was dumb last night ahahah


[12-Aug-21 12:35 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ohh i never thought about how mice(mouses??) would affect left handed ppl hmmm


[12-Aug-21 12:35 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
true true


[12-Aug-21 12:36 AM] king of cats#9205
well i can't exactly use power tools without being extremely careful


[12-Aug-21 12:36 AM] king of cats#9205
:3


[12-Aug-21 12:36 AM] Viridion#0234
They make left handed and ambidextrous nice too right


[12-Aug-21 12:36 AM] Viridion#0234
Mice


[12-Aug-21 12:36 AM] king of cats#9205
they do but it's uncommon


[12-Aug-21 12:36 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i dont touch those my hands are sooo shaky


[12-Aug-21 12:36 AM] king of cats#9205
usually if you go out places, then you end up seeing the right handed mouse


[12-Aug-21 12:36 AM] king of cats#9205
i also learned to flip right handed scissors


[12-Aug-21 12:37 AM] Viridion#0234
Flip?


[12-Aug-21 12:37 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh yeah i guess a lot of left handed people have to learn to use their right anways bc its so much more common


[12-Aug-21 12:37 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
wait like take it apart or just hold it in a way that works better?


[12-Aug-21 12:38 AM] Viridion#0234
Oooh


[12-Aug-21 12:38 AM] Viridion#0234
I thought you meant throw it in the air


[12-Aug-21 12:38 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
LOL


[12-Aug-21 12:38 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i definitely didnt think of it that way


[12-Aug-21 12:38 AM] king of cats#9205
i have to turn them the other way


[12-Aug-21 12:38 AM] king of cats#9205
like usually you hold them one way, i use them in the mirror of that


[12-Aug-21 12:39 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
wait like with the pointy part towards you?


[12-Aug-21 12:40 AM] king of cats#9205

[12-Aug-21 08:24 AM] alexavndra#4425
i'm like ???? most of the time


[12-Aug-21 08:26 AM] king of cats#9205
it sounds like multiplication though


[12-Aug-21 08:26 AM] king of cats#9205
when someone says ‚Äúproduct‚Äù doesn‚Äôt that usually mean multiply?


[12-Aug-21 08:27 AM] king of cats#9205
it sounds like they‚Äôre asking you to make sure that you find the pair of numbers that make the largest positive product


[12-Aug-21 08:28 AM] alexavndra#4425
ooh true


[12-Aug-21 08:31 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
but then how can 4 and 0 be answers?

[12-Aug-21 08:32 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
Does it mean 4 * 1


[12-Aug-21 08:32 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
= 4


[12-Aug-21 08:32 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
and 4,1 to list what needs to be multiplied?


[12-Aug-21 08:32 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
OOPS I DID TEXT TO SPEECH


[12-Aug-21 08:33 AM] alexavndra#4425
i think it's either asking for the pair that needs to be multiplied to get the maximum OR the highest number on the list?? idk


[12-Aug-21 08:34 AM] king of cats#9205
i interpreted that as either submitting [4,1] or just [4] since it's four that maximizes not really 1


[12-Aug-21 08:35 AM] king of cats#9205
but it could also be what alex said

[12-Aug-21 05:19 PM] king of cats#9205
instead they waived my sciences


[12-Aug-21 05:19 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
Why do they make it physically impossible to get from one class to another by they start and finish?


[12-Aug-21 05:19 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
Like for DSC 10 and DSC 96 you have 10 minutes to travel halfway across campus


[12-Aug-21 05:19 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652

[12-Aug-21 05:19 PM] prorick#5620

[12-Aug-21 05:23 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
So like I can‚Äôt take music ;-;


[12-Aug-21 05:23 PM] prorick#5620
invest in scooters, bikes, roller skates, or skateboards !!!


[12-Aug-21 05:23 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i only planned a list i wanted, but not when im taking them yet and im already getting confused ahhh


[12-Aug-21 05:23 PM] prorick#5620
Yes, some classes are only offered in certain quarters


[12-Aug-21 05:24 PM] king of cats#9205
ahahah i'm looking at their default plan and crossing off a bunch of whatever doesn't apply to me which is a fair bit


[12-Aug-21 05:24 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
Yeah.. or like I had to add a math course cause I didn‚Äôt take AP Calc in high school


[12-Aug-21 05:24 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
So I‚Äôm hesitant to do anything that‚Äôs not a GE or what I‚Äôm planning for a minor


[12-Aug-21 05:25 PM] king of cats#9205
ohhhh that's a fair concern


[12-Aug-21 05:25 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
Maybe some of your base ge's can be swapped around?


[12-Aug-21 05:25 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
Hum can‚Äôt be and I don‚Äôt wanna take physics since it uses basic calculus


[12-Aug-21 05:25 PM] king of cats#9205
a trick i've seen some students do is take some ges at community college over summer


[12-Aug-21 05:25 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ive tried to overlap as much as i can but i have to take so many random courses for ge's


[12-Aug-21 05:25 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
I‚Äôm thinking of Chemistry and Buology


[12-Aug-21 05:26 PM] king of cats#9205
idk where they were in their progress towards graduation but it was something i saw often during summers


[12-Aug-21 05:26 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
I‚Äôm going to have to take math 18, 20C over summer to be on track for DSC 40


[12-Aug-21 05:26 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
Then the next summers I‚Äôm gonna do HUM


[12-Aug-21 05:26 PM] king of cats#9205
i'm actually kinda curious about the hum classes


[12-Aug-21 05:26 PM] king of cats#9205
i only got 1 waived


[12-Aug-21 05:26 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
You got one waived?


[12-Aug-21 05:26 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
is that the revelle writing course?


[12-Aug-21 05:26 PM] king of cats#9205
yeah


[12-Aug-21 05:26 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
Yes


[12-Aug-21 05:26 PM] king of cats#9205
i took more than enough college classes to technically have them all waived


[12-Aug-21 05:26 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh wow i didnt realize any of the college specific ones could be waived


[12-Aug-21 05:26 PM] king of cats#9205
but they were like nope


[12-Aug-21 05:27 PM] king of cats#9205
you can check your degree audit


[12-Aug-21 05:27 PM] king of cats#9205
that's how i found out revelle decide to take my science instead of my humanities


[12-Aug-21 05:27 PM] king of cats#9205
the degree audit is in tritonlink :3


[12-Aug-21 05:27 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
that's so strange... do they specify anything about it?


[12-Aug-21 05:27 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh yeah ive looked at it but i basically knew the few classes i had waived anyways from aps lol


[12-Aug-21 05:27 PM] king of cats#9205
honestly i'm so glad they took my science, my chemistry and physics were not fun


[12-Aug-21 05:28 PM] king of cats#9205
plus the physics i took wasn't lab physics ahahah


[12-Aug-21 05:28 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh thats good then!


[12-Aug-21 05:28 PM] king of cats#9205
but idk what to expect with humanities ahahah


[12-Aug-21 05:28 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i think i actually barely need any more stem courses which is so strange to me because i've said my whole life that i liked stem >>>>> humanities


[12-Aug-21 05:29 PM] king of cats#9205
ahahah


[12-Aug-21 05:29 PM] king of cats#9205
i'm like humanities > stem because i can make more things up ahahah


[12-Aug-21 05:29 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
science and math were always my fav subjects ahahha i hated eng and history


[12-Aug-21 05:30 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
but now, i just need math 18


[12-Aug-21 05:30 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
and im done with math probably


[12-Aug-21 05:30 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
(i dont wanna do machine learning or else i need so many more math classes LOL i forgot all of calc tho)


[12-Aug-21 05:30 PM] king of cats#9205
oh wow


[12-Aug-21 05:30 PM] king of cats#9205
that's super niceeeeee


[12-Aug-21 05:30 PM] king of cats#9205
i have to retake calc bc since i dropped it a while back


[12-Aug-21 05:30 PM] king of cats#9205
i'm looking at the humanities sequences for revelle


[12-Aug-21 05:31 PM] king of cats#9205
and they're kinda funny


[12-Aug-21 05:31 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
im hoping that i dont end up hating cogsci because today i  made a list of what i want to take


[12-Aug-21 05:31 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh what do yall need to take?


[12-Aug-21 05:31 PM] king of cats#9205
it's like whap


[12-Aug-21 05:31 PM] king of cats#9205
honestly it all sounds like history


[12-Aug-21 05:32 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
blegh


[12-Aug-21 05:32 PM] king of cats#9205
i did quite well in whap so i think i'll be fine


[12-Aug-21 05:32 PM] prorick#5620

Click degree Audit to see the list of classes you need to take for your major/minor/GEs


[12-Aug-21 05:33 PM] pain.#9573
how bad is it to have 2 finals on the same day


[12-Aug-21 05:33 PM] prorick#5620
Degree audit is something I always check every quarter to see where I am at, and helps a lot to plan for the future. Its nice to see what classes you already have credit for from AP credits and CC courses


[12-Aug-21 05:33 PM] king of cats#9205
depends what classes


[12-Aug-21 05:33 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
I have DSC 10 and Math 4C on the same day


[12-Aug-21 05:33 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i was planning on changing my major kinda so i didnt really take too close of a look on the audit


[12-Aug-21 05:33 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
For finals


[12-Aug-21 05:33 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
Which sounds horrid


[12-Aug-21 05:34 PM] prorick#5620
2 finals on the same day isn't the worst, but can be esp if its a math class. Usually humanities are an essay you turn in online. My friend had 3 finals in one day and its the absolute worst


[12-Aug-21 05:34 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
What‚Äôre you changing to?


[12-Aug-21 05:34 PM] king of cats#9205
^^^


[12-Aug-21 05:34 PM] pain.#9573
its basically the sixth college CAT writing course thing + cogs 9


[12-Aug-21 05:35 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh i just wanted to add a specialization which changes the elective stuff kinda


[12-Aug-21 05:35 PM] king of cats#9205
ohhhh specialization!!! which one???


[12-Aug-21 05:35 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
but if i end up hating this major i rly dont know what ill do lol


[12-Aug-21 05:35 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i think design and interaction :)


[12-Aug-21 05:35 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
doesnt require all those extra math classes lol


[12-Aug-21 05:35 PM] king of cats#9205
ohhhh that's nice


[12-Aug-21 05:35 PM] king of cats#9205
practically everyone i know is like TAKE A CS MINOR WITH YOUR MAJOR


[12-Aug-21 05:35 PM] king of cats#9205
so watch me not sleep :3


[12-Aug-21 05:36 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh i used to wanna take a cs minor


[12-Aug-21 05:36 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
but


[12-Aug-21 05:36 PM] king of cats#9205
it's fine though cause i know a few other night owls lmfao


[12-Aug-21 05:36 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i still really dont wanna do those math classes LOL


[12-Aug-21 05:36 PM] king of cats#9205
i mean i figure as long as i pass the math classes, i can make my humanities carry my gpa lmfao


[12-Aug-21 05:36 PM] prorick#5620
You will be fine. Cogs 9 is a very fun and chill class. Whos the prof this quarter? And CAT final will most likely be a paper so if you dont procrastinate you should be fine


[12-Aug-21 05:37 PM] pain.#9573
Fleischer


[12-Aug-21 05:37 PM] pain.#9573
CAPES looks solid so


[12-Aug-21 05:37 PM] prorick#5620

[12-Aug-21 05:38 PM] prorick#5620
I took it last winter and it was a super chill and easy class


[12-Aug-21 05:38 PM] pain.#9573

[12-Aug-21 05:39 PM] prorick#5620
In general, for the writing sequences, your grade depends on your TA, so def make a good impression, and hope your TA is nice


[12-Aug-21 05:39 PM] pain.#9573
gotcha


[12-Aug-21 05:40 PM] king of cats#9205
can anyone from revelle tell me how hard the humanities reqs are?


[12-Aug-21 05:45 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
@John._.


[12-Aug-21 05:46 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
He‚Äôs the mentor from Revelle, he‚Äôs gonna hate me for pinging him so much. XD


[12-Aug-21 05:46 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
He‚Äôs my role model XD


[12-Aug-21 05:46 PM] king of cats#9205
ahahah


[12-Aug-21 05:48 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ack just talked to my parents and theyre just like "yeah you should definitely minor in cs"


[12-Aug-21 05:48 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
welp time to look at everything again!


[12-Aug-21 05:59 PM] king of cats#9205
good luck jennyyyy


[12-Aug-21 06:00 PM] John._.#1301
depending on what your cogs subdomain is / what your advisor said there might be a lot of overlap


[12-Aug-21 06:00 PM] John._.#1301
basically ap lit


[12-Aug-21 06:00 PM] king of cats#9205
oh okay then that's not that bad at all lmao


[12-Aug-21 06:01 PM] king of cats#9205
i took the college equivalent of ap lit so i think i should be fine

{Reactions}
üëç 

[12-Aug-21 06:01 PM] John._.#1301
hum 1 and 2 are 6 unit classes so theres a lot of reading and writing time commitment


[12-Aug-21 06:01 PM] John._.#1301
try to take kristina markman if you can

{Reactions}
üëç 

[12-Aug-21 06:03 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
my advisor just answered a few of the questions i had but i had no intention of minoring at the time lol so i dont really know


[12-Aug-21 06:04 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i feel like i may not even be able to get into the classes i need though


[12-Aug-21 06:04 PM] king of cats#9205
you could always email them!!!

{Reactions}
üíõ 

[12-Aug-21 06:05 PM] king of cats#9205
i'm p sure you need to email your college's advisor


[12-Aug-21 06:06 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh righttt i forgot we could submit q's tyy


[12-Aug-21 06:07 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
technically i have space for 20 more classes as of now if i take 4 classes per quarter and everything fulfills a req lol


[12-Aug-21 06:10 PM] Wonder Oz#3837
@John._. do u have time later to talk about data science?


[12-Aug-21 06:12 PM] king of cats#9205
i'm finally planning things out and i keep smudging my writing i- 
;w;


[12-Aug-21 06:13 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ah im doing everything online


[12-Aug-21 06:14 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
You could graduate early


[12-Aug-21 06:14 PM] king of cats#9205
that's honestly a great idea lmao
i would if i didn't particularly prefer paper


[12-Aug-21 06:16 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i'm expecting to miss a lot of classes i need tho, and i was actually scared i couldnt graduate in 4 years before i committed to ucsd lol


[12-Aug-21 06:16 PM] ferreti#0348
pick up a minor!


[12-Aug-21 06:16 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh wait theres no harm in declaring a minor and not completing it right?


[12-Aug-21 06:17 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
I don‚Äôt think so


[12-Aug-21 06:17 PM] ferreti#0348
i mean u could always take classes that align with the minor?


[12-Aug-21 06:17 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
@prorick


[12-Aug-21 06:17 PM] ferreti#0348
without officially declaring


[12-Aug-21 06:17 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
He‚Äôs the all knowing minor person


[12-Aug-21 06:17 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
I asked him about it earlier


[12-Aug-21 06:18 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh i thought declaring might help me plan but i dont rly know


[12-Aug-21 06:18 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
Is there a chat for random questions I come up with like: is Michael‚Äôs favorite food lasagna?


[12-Aug-21 06:19 PM] king of cats#9205
we need that


[12-Aug-21 06:19 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
someone could prboably make one :D


[12-Aug-21 06:19 PM] king of cats#9205
i will probably have really random questions


[12-Aug-21 06:19 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
@John._. can we have a chat with random questions?


[12-Aug-21 06:19 PM] king of cats#9205
also i just looked at my remaining revelle ge's and i don't have much lmao


[12-Aug-21 06:19 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652

[12-Aug-21 06:20 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
I have like 1 year of extra college I guess? But I don‚Äôt think it applies for UCSD


[12-Aug-21 06:20 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
I took AP‚Äôs but didn‚Äôt take the AP test and did community college


[12-Aug-21 06:20 PM] king of cats#9205
ohhhhhhhhhhh that's cool!


[12-Aug-21 06:21 PM] king of cats#9205
i spent 2 years as a full time cc student :3


[12-Aug-21 06:21 PM] king of cats#9205
while in high school ofc


[12-Aug-21 06:21 PM] king of cats#9205
honestly though cc is wild, i had one cc on semester and that was my main one but i also did some classes with a diff one on quarter and their breaks *never* aligned


[12-Aug-21 06:25 PM] diegom1#3882
@Wonder Oz he might be busy rn but I'm pretty sure he's hella down and has time to talk about it with u!


[12-Aug-21 06:27 PM] Wonder Oz#3837

oh i havent looked at that one oops


[12-Aug-21 06:52 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
also we cant waitlist classes first pass right?


[12-Aug-21 06:58 PM] king of cats#9205
so according to what i heard yesterday at the revelle thingy i attended they said we don't have a first and second pass for this upcoming enrollment


[12-Aug-21 06:58 PM] king of cats#9205
but if you're not sure, you should def drop by your college's web registration webinar or watch the recording if they have one up


[12-Aug-21 06:58 PM] crossboy#7777
correct! no 1st/2nd pass for your enrollment for your first quarter


[12-Aug-21 06:58 PM] crossboy#7777
but during your following quarters, you are correct @jennosaur‚ô° no waitlists on first pass


[12-Aug-21 06:59 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh interesting so i can enroll in as many as i want?


[12-Aug-21 06:59 PM] crossboy#7777
i believe ther'es still a limit but not sure what it is


[12-Aug-21 06:59 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
the last webinar is tmrw so im just waiting for recordings since theyre all spis times lol


[12-Aug-21 06:59 PM] crossboy#7777
i think it's 20 before the first day of the quarter


[12-Aug-21 06:59 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678

[12-Aug-21 07:13 PM] king of cats#9205
but instead i stayed up late


[12-Aug-21 07:14 PM] king of cats#9205
i napped *sooooo* much during my final semester of high school, i can't tell you what was happening in any of my classes


[12-Aug-21 07:15 PM] king of cats#9205
josh, are you in a different time zone or do you just like staying up late?
i usually see you're still on at like 1-2 am


[12-Aug-21 07:16 PM] crossboy#7777
i have trouble falling asleep haha


[12-Aug-21 07:16 PM] crossboy#7777
im usually up much later than that as well


[12-Aug-21 07:17 PM] king of cats#9205
ohhhhh that makes a lot of sense, i'm usually up at that time unless i've brute forced myself into sleeping earlier


[12-Aug-21 07:17 PM] king of cats#9205

[12-Aug-21 08:39 PM] king of cats#9205
all that's contingent on me actually getting classes as planned


[12-Aug-21 08:39 PM] king of cats#9205

i'd ask my brother for you since he knows more coding than i do, but i think i thoroughly traumatized him last time asking him to check what i was coding in python


[12-Aug-21 08:46 PM] king of cats#9205
he's supposed to be taking a java class

But like sitting in chairs for so long hurts


[12-Aug-21 11:28 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
Maybe I should do class on my bed


[12-Aug-21 11:28 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
But then I feel like I couldn‚Äôt have my camera on


[12-Aug-21 11:28 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
Cause I feel like that‚Äôs weird


[12-Aug-21 11:28 PM] king of cats#9205
i sit in a chair for hours and i feel nothing lmao


[12-Aug-21 11:28 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652

[12-Aug-21 11:28 PM] king of cats#9205
lmaoooo


[12-Aug-21 11:28 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
Too many embarrassing things could happen


[12-Aug-21 11:29 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
It‚Äôs not worth it


[12-Aug-21 11:29 PM] king of cats#9205
i think the only embarrassing thing that could pawsibly happen rn would be me making random faces at the camera


[12-Aug-21 11:29 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
XD why would you do that


[12-Aug-21 11:29 PM] king of cats#9205
idk where i show up on zooms for everyone else, but if i think no one is watching i make a weird face


[12-Aug-21 11:29 PM] king of cats#9205
well it's funnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn


[12-Aug-21 11:30 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
I don‚Äôt know that seems wonky to me


[12-Aug-21 11:30 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
I get self conscious when I have to talk then my zoom like shows up


[12-Aug-21 11:30 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
In front of everyone


[12-Aug-21 11:30 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
0/10


[12-Aug-21 11:30 PM] king of cats#9205
plus if someone does catch me making a funny face, i bet it makes them laugh


[12-Aug-21 11:30 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
I never look at people except professors when they do lecture


[12-Aug-21 11:30 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
Cause I wouldn‚Äôt want anyone to look at me


[12-Aug-21 11:31 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
So I try to not look


[12-Aug-21 11:31 PM] king of cats#9205
ohhhh that's fair


[12-Aug-21 11:31 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
Sometimes mentors like Diego have funny backgrounds though


[12-Aug-21 11:31 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
And I feel inclined to comment on them


[12-Aug-21 11:31 PM] king of cats#9205
yes they dooooooooo


[12-Aug-21 11:31 PM] king of cats#9205
i like looking at people's backgrounds


[12-Aug-21 11:31 PM] king of cats#9205
especially when they swap them around


[12-Aug-21 11:32 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
I‚Äôm just happy, with Prothit‚Äôs amazing recommendation and approval, that my classes are mostly figured out


[12-Aug-21 11:32 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
For this quarter at least


[12-Aug-21 11:32 PM] king of cats#9205
yayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy that's great!!!!!


[12-Aug-21 11:32 PM] king of cats#9205

[12-Aug-21 11:32 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
I started planning cause we have to pick classes in like 6 days


[12-Aug-21 11:32 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652

[12-Aug-21 11:32 PM] king of cats#9205
like i have the thingy and then i forgot


[12-Aug-21 11:32 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
So you do know just not right now?


[12-Aug-21 11:32 PM] king of cats#9205
i think picking classes isn't that scary compared to everything else


[12-Aug-21 11:32 PM] king of cats#9205
well it's somewhere


[12-Aug-21 11:33 PM] lyd#9524
i painted with my friend but the paintings r horrendous ü§£ü§£

well at least you had fun!!!
also hi lydia!!! :3


[12-Aug-21 11:33 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
I think it‚Äôs more scary than public speaking


[12-Aug-21 11:33 PM] king of cats#9205
oh that reminds me zoe, are you going to get back 4 blood?


[12-Aug-21 11:33 PM] lyd#9524
yeaa it was an interesting experience. we gave up in the middle. also yesh hellooo


[12-Aug-21 11:33 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
What does that mean?


[12-Aug-21 11:33 PM] king of cats#9205
really? i must be desensitized then


[12-Aug-21 11:34 PM] king of cats#9205
isn't it the game that comes after dead by daylight or did i remember wrong? it's been a while


[12-Aug-21 11:34 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
Well I‚Äôm not scared of public speaking


[12-Aug-21 11:34 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
I just want to be academically ready, challenged, and like good


[12-Aug-21 11:34 PM] king of cats#9205
that is fairrrrrrrrrrrrr


[12-Aug-21 11:34 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
That‚Äôs what college is for me XD academics.


[12-Aug-21 11:34 PM] king of cats#9205
oh college is social time for me


[12-Aug-21 11:34 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
I want it to be good and go as planned cause it‚Äôs important


[12-Aug-21 11:35 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
College is really expensive and I wanna make sure I don‚Äôt take unnecessary classes or like stuff that costs more


[12-Aug-21 11:35 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
Cause it‚Äôs not gonna be easy to pay for it


[12-Aug-21 11:35 PM] king of cats#9205
so trueeeeee


[12-Aug-21 11:35 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
I already feel kinda bad for staying in the dorms when I could commute


[12-Aug-21 11:35 PM] king of cats#9205
i think commuting can change the experience you have though


[12-Aug-21 11:35 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
But mom doesn‚Äôt want me to commute and says college dorm experience is really important


[12-Aug-21 11:36 PM] king of cats#9205
cause my local school is sjsu and it's a full blown commuter school


[12-Aug-21 11:36 PM] king of cats#9205
so it's a lot more like a community college where everyone just goes to class and that's it


[12-Aug-21 11:36 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
Idek how I would commute because all the parking would be full


[12-Aug-21 11:36 PM] king of cats#9205
that is also trueeeeeeeeeee


[12-Aug-21 11:37 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
It‚Äôs hard cause mom tells me not to worry but I‚Äôm like


[12-Aug-21 11:37 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
I have 3 siblings 1 already in college 1 graduating next year


[12-Aug-21 11:37 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652

[12-Aug-21 11:40 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652

[12-Aug-21 11:40 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
The only horror game I play is dead by daylight


[12-Aug-21 11:40 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
And I have to take breaks because I get so scared that I‚Äôm shaking and sweating


[12-Aug-21 11:40 PM] king of cats#9205

Scary killer chases you and then pits you on hooks


[12-Aug-21 11:41 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
You have to complete generators in order to escape


[12-Aug-21 11:41 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
There are tools and stuff to help or hinder you


[12-Aug-21 11:41 PM] king of cats#9205
yeah i saw dead by daylight 2 last month


[12-Aug-21 11:41 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
It was on sale I think


[12-Aug-21 11:41 PM] king of cats#9205
it was indeed difficult


[12-Aug-21 11:42 PM] king of cats#9205

[12-Aug-21 11:42 PM] king of cats#9205

[12-Aug-21 11:42 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
I bought it with money I earned


[12-Aug-21 11:42 PM] king of cats#9205

I don‚Äôt know what killer that is


[12-Aug-21 11:43 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
But there is a palette you can throw


[12-Aug-21 11:43 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
The killer has to walk around it or kick it


[12-Aug-21 11:44 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
You run lots of loops in this game


[12-Aug-21 11:44 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
You can also blind killers with the flashlight


[12-Aug-21 11:44 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
And crouch to hide or be softer


[12-Aug-21 11:44 PM] king of cats#9205
oh that is cool!!!!!!!!!


[12-Aug-21 11:45 PM] king of cats#9205
i just googled it and i think i've seen the cover around but never the game


[12-Aug-21 11:45 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
Yeah I was unfamiliar with it for a long time


[12-Aug-21 11:45 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
My friends said I shouldn‚Äôt watch cause I‚Äôd get nightmares


[12-Aug-21 11:45 PM] king of cats#9205
i think the first horror game i ever saw played was outlast


[12-Aug-21 11:45 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652

[12-Aug-21 11:45 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
Honestly, John makes me wanna go back and play league of legends


[12-Aug-21 11:46 PM] king of cats#9205

lmaooo zoe


[12-Aug-21 11:53 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
Aerin why do so many people stalk you


[12-Aug-21 11:53 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
I think you should talk to the police


[12-Aug-21 11:53 PM] king of cats#9205
it;s the same dude though


[12-Aug-21 11:53 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
And an adult


[12-Aug-21 11:53 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
@crossboy do you know law stuff


[12-Aug-21 11:53 PM] king of cats#9205
he's the creepy stalker dude who sent me his contact info a year after i blocked him


[12-Aug-21 11:53 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652

[12-Aug-21 11:53 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
Get a judge


[12-Aug-21 11:53 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
Or a lawyer


[12-Aug-21 11:53 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
For a restraining order


[12-Aug-21 11:53 PM] king of cats#9205
unfortunately, one of the other girls he stalked said that police did nothing


[12-Aug-21 11:54 PM] king of cats#9205
and what he did with that person was wayyyy worse cause he knew where they lived lmao


[12-Aug-21 11:54 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
That‚Äôs why you get a restraining order


[12-Aug-21 11:54 PM] king of cats#9205
i'm in no immediate danger lmao


[12-Aug-21 11:54 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
Then he can get arrested


[12-Aug-21 11:54 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
Say you feel unsafe


[12-Aug-21 11:54 PM] king of cats#9205
~~he should have been arrested a year ago but wasn't~~


[12-Aug-21 11:55 PM] king of cats#9205
it's no biggie


[12-Aug-21 11:55 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652

I‚Äôm seriously concerned

pfft i have four exes and he's the only one creepily attached but it's fine


[12-Aug-21 11:55 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
I feel like parents should be involved


[12-Aug-21 11:55 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
Like this can develop to worse things


[12-Aug-21 11:55 PM] king of cats#9205
i know

but it's fine


[12-Aug-21 11:55 PM] king of cats#9205
i know what goes on in his brain


[12-Aug-21 11:56 PM] king of cats#9205
he'll let go of me pretty soon cause his "dream" is to find his "the one" at college at a bus stop


[12-Aug-21 11:56 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
I would have to say I don‚Äôt agree because anything can happen in peoples brain


[12-Aug-21 11:56 PM] king of cats#9205
i highly doubt i'm in any danger


[12-Aug-21 11:56 PM] king of cats#9205
i'm leaving in a little more than a month :3


[12-Aug-21 11:56 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
If he shows up on campus you get the police involved


[12-Aug-21 11:56 PM] king of cats#9205
he's not going to come to ucsd lmao


[12-Aug-21 11:57 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
If you won‚Äôt then I will or someone else will because that‚Äôs not okay


[12-Aug-21 11:57 PM] king of cats#9205

[12-Aug-21 11:58 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
I know you‚Äôre an adult but I don‚Äôt feel like we are true adults


[12-Aug-21 11:58 PM] king of cats#9205
ahahahahahah


[12-Aug-21 11:58 PM] king of cats#9205
then how old is a true adult


[12-Aug-21 11:58 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
Like that kinda stuff is scary and can mess with you mentally


[12-Aug-21 11:58 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
A 35 year old


[12-Aug-21 11:58 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
Unless they act like a child


[12-Aug-21 11:58 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
Maybe 50


[12-Aug-21 11:59 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
It depends


[12-Aug-21 11:59 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
It throws me for a loop cause I can‚Äôt tell how old people are


[12-Aug-21 11:59 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
So in my brain Niema is like 30


[12-Aug-21 11:59 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
Curt is like 40


[12-Aug-21 11:59 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
And Gary is 45


[12-Aug-21 11:59 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
Because he has facial hair


[12-Aug-21 11:59 PM] king of cats#9205
lmaoooooo


[12-Aug-21 11:59 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
But I don‚Äôt know how accurate those numbers are


[13-Aug-21 12:00 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
But I‚Äôd view all our professors as true adults


[13-Aug-21 12:00 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
I think it depends on maturity level


[13-Aug-21 12:00 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
And knowledge


[13-Aug-21 12:00 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
The more knowledge the more adult


[13-Aug-21 12:01 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
@king of cats are you gonna join the WIC club Lindsey helps with?


[13-Aug-21 12:01 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
I think I‚Äôm going to, it looks like a lot of fun


[13-Aug-21 12:02 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
I kinda got sucked in to that one though I wanted to check the D3S one too


[13-Aug-21 12:02 AM] king of cats#9205
i‚Äôm not sure if i wanna join that club yet :3


[13-Aug-21 12:03 AM] king of cats#9205
i‚Äôm probably going to wait until i‚Äôm on campus to decide what clubs


[13-Aug-21 12:03 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
Do you have one in mind you want?


[13-Aug-21 12:03 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
Or that makes sense


[13-Aug-21 12:03 AM] king of cats#9205
not particularly tbh


[13-Aug-21 12:03 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
I‚Äôd wanna join a club with cooking if there was one


[13-Aug-21 12:03 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
I like cooking


[13-Aug-21 12:04 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
But that‚Äôs not really data related lol


[13-Aug-21 12:04 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
Unless we count every recipe as an algorithm


[13-Aug-21 12:04 AM] king of cats#9205
i don't think every club you join has to be related to your major thoughhhhhhhh


[13-Aug-21 12:04 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
That‚Äôs true


[13-Aug-21 12:04 AM] king of cats#9205
i remember when one of the ucs visited my school they said they had a costco club


[13-Aug-21 12:04 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652

[13-Aug-21 12:05 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
I have a Costco muffin every day for breakfast


[13-Aug-21 12:05 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
Except we ran out today


[13-Aug-21 12:05 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
That‚Äôs not always true


[13-Aug-21 12:05 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
Sometimes I‚Äôll have egg


[13-Aug-21 12:05 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
But I like muffin


[13-Aug-21 12:05 AM] king of cats#9205
their muffins are biggggggggg


[13-Aug-21 12:05 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
I know that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs great


[13-Aug-21 12:05 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
I had the muffin then didn‚Äôt eat again until 7


[13-Aug-21 12:06 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
You just have enough food for a while


[13-Aug-21 12:06 AM] king of cats#9205
wow that's a long time


[13-Aug-21 12:06 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
Yeah I ate the muffin at like 8 aM


[13-Aug-21 12:06 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
But I think I got hungry in the middle of coding and ignored it


[13-Aug-21 12:06 AM] king of cats#9205
still,,, isn;t that around 11 hours


[13-Aug-21 12:06 AM] king of cats#9205

[13-Aug-21 12:07 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652

[13-Aug-21 12:08 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
I don‚Äôt understand


[13-Aug-21 12:08 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
Sorry


[13-Aug-21 12:08 AM] king of cats#9205
disordered eating just means i don't eat on a regular schedule


[13-Aug-21 12:08 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
Ohhh


[13-Aug-21 12:08 AM] king of cats#9205
sometimes i eat all three meals and sometimes it's just one


[13-Aug-21 12:08 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652

Not necessarily split between two hands, sometimes my hands cross over to the other half of the keyboard

:o do you guys have more spots??


[13-Aug-21 12:34 AM] lyd#9524

[13-Aug-21 12:34 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
theyre all already wl for me


[13-Aug-21 12:34 AM] Viridion#0234
Oh fuck lemme check


[13-Aug-21 12:34 AM] ferreti#0348
they take people off waitlist for cse classes


[13-Aug-21 12:34 AM] Viridion#0234
Wait don‚Äôt SPIS kids get priority or smth


[13-Aug-21 12:34 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
yeppp and you might need those lower div creds anyways?


[13-Aug-21 12:34 AM] ferreti#0348
so everything should be waitlisted


[13-Aug-21 12:34 AM] Viridion#0234
Yea that


[13-Aug-21 12:34 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh really?


[13-Aug-21 12:35 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
hmm i didnt think i could get it so i was gonna try for another course i wasnt even gonna take til next year...


[13-Aug-21 12:36 AM] lyd#9524
o wot


[13-Aug-21 12:36 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i was thinking that cs majors had a lot more spots bc every DI for me just says 10 spots


[13-Aug-21 12:36 AM] lyd#9524
samee mine did that too


[13-Aug-21 12:37 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
hmm now i dont know if i should try to get the class or not lol i was just gonna wait til next quarter


[13-Aug-21 12:37 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
things might be even worse then idk


[13-Aug-21 12:38 AM] Viridion#0234
Which class?


[13-Aug-21 12:39 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
cse 11


[13-Aug-21 12:41 AM] crossboy#7777
the CSE classes have a special kind of enrollment - they'll say they're full with 0 seats available because none of the seats are actually released. You waitlist into the class, then you'll get an email in a little bit that says you can enroll in the class (they give you a special permission that lets you enroll in the fake "full" class).


[13-Aug-21 12:42 AM] crossboy#7777
So you should definitely waitlist into the CSE classes you want!


[13-Aug-21 12:42 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ohhh that's so strange


[13-Aug-21 12:42 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ty tho!! might redo my schedule then lol


[13-Aug-21 12:43 AM] crossboy#7777
yup it's weird but it's just to make sure people have priority properly


[13-Aug-21 12:45 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
not sure how my priority will be as a cogsci major but i think i'll try to get it instead of linear alg then :)


[13-Aug-21 12:50 AM] king of cats#9205
ahahahah i'm retaking all my math :3


[13-Aug-21 12:58 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
if i can actually get the class, my two back to back ones will both be center then!


[13-Aug-21 12:58 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
and will get rid of the one in wlh lol


[13-Aug-21 12:58 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678

ahahahah


[15-Aug-21 03:18 PM] king of cats#9205
if i can force myself to not sleep after getting my covid shot, i think it's gonna take a lot more work to get me to sleep normally


[15-Aug-21 03:19 PM] king of cats#9205
technically, i *could* wake up early and it would be much better for me than staying up late (i've tried both)
buuuuut staying up late is more convenient


[15-Aug-21 03:19 PM] king of cats#9205
plus it's cold in the morning often


[15-Aug-21 03:23 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
exactly and tbh i dont get why waking up early is better? my dad said smth about inner clock and getting the sunlight but ehh i just pretend im in another country


[15-Aug-21 03:23 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
o gosh i slept all day after second dose lol my head was dying in stats class so i crashed after


[15-Aug-21 03:23 PM] crossboy#7777
it has to do with circadian rythm i think, but i'd argue that even if it's better to wake up early, it's also much more important to get a full night's sleep lol


[15-Aug-21 03:34 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
darn it there's a legit reason lol but yeah thats why i sleep in whenever i can instead of forcing myself to wake up early on weekends hehe


[15-Aug-21 04:10 PM] king of cats#9205
ahahah i was supposed to be good at bio :3


[15-Aug-21 04:10 PM] king of cats#9205
but i also ignored most of the things i learned from bio


[15-Aug-21 04:10 PM] king of cats#9205
by much better for me, i just mean that i can get the same things done that i do at like 12am but with less trouble


[15-Aug-21 04:12 PM] king of cats#9205
so if i really wanted to do things "properly" i should go to bed early and wake up at like 5 to 6 am


[15-Aug-21 04:19 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh thats so interesting lol


[15-Aug-21 04:20 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
for me, i just know that im more productive the closer it is to the deadline, but sometimes waking up early is a gamle (i might snooze too much)


[15-Aug-21 04:20 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i did not learn in ap bio at all this year uhh the senioritis hit hard :))


[15-Aug-21 04:22 PM] king of cats#9205
same ahahahahah 
i rarely do things early because my brain can't think of anything lmao


[15-Aug-21 04:22 PM] king of cats#9205
i didn't pay attention once things went online in spring 2020 ahahahah


[15-Aug-21 04:23 PM] king of cats#9205
i took human anatomy then and then cell bio
i remember almost nothing from both


[15-Aug-21 05:08 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
exactly i feel like its such a waste of time if i try to start early and do nothing lolll


[15-Aug-21 05:08 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
o gosh same here idk why i did better on ap stuff senior year tho


[15-Aug-21 05:08 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
yeah i dont even remember anything that isnt 7th grade science level


[15-Aug-21 05:10 PM] king of cats#9205

[15-Aug-21 05:10 PM] king of cats#9205

[15-Aug-21 06:22 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ive been trying to figure out how much i have to run to get to wlh lol


[15-Aug-21 06:22 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i guess that makes sense but some of these new sixth buildings are annoying because i dont know the campus enough to choose something near it if it doesnt pop up lmao


[15-Aug-21 06:23 PM] king of cats#9205
yeah they really are


[15-Aug-21 06:23 PM] king of cats#9205
the placement is also weird


[15-Aug-21 06:23 PM] king of cats#9205
some classes have discussion afterwards and then the discussion is a whole 16 minutes away


[15-Aug-21 06:23 PM] king of cats#9205
as if that was logical


[15-Aug-21 06:24 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ikr... i didnt realize discussions were kinda optional but i was trying to plan around that


[15-Aug-21 06:24 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i keep switching up my schedule that by the time enrollment happens, ill probably just be confsued


[15-Aug-21 06:27 PM] king of cats#9205
wait they are??? i thought they weren't aaaaaaa


[15-Aug-21 06:28 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i dont even know anymore


[15-Aug-21 06:28 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i think its still a very good idea to show up


[15-Aug-21 06:28 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
maybe its like how lectures are "optional" but you should go lol


[15-Aug-21 06:28 PM] king of cats#9205
well ofc but if it's not mandatory üëÄ


[15-Aug-21 06:29 PM] king of cats#9205
i won't have to stress myself as much over time conflicts if they aren't ahahah


[15-Aug-21 06:29 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
hmm i just searched and it seems like it depends on class/prof


[15-Aug-21 06:29 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
so


[15-Aug-21 06:30 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
may be not rly useful until you go


[15-Aug-21 06:30 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
reddit recommends to email the prof if you wanna know before the syllabus is out lol


[15-Aug-21 06:34 PM] king of cats#9205
a r g h


[15-Aug-21 06:34 PM] king of cats#9205
okay


[15-Aug-21 06:34 PM] king of cats#9205
not bad


[15-Aug-21 06:35 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
welp after all that now im in the mood for ramen and i may go eat some *hopefully aps doesnt take me too long bc i wrote bullet points so far*


[15-Aug-21 06:35 PM] king of cats#9205
lmaooo aps


[15-Aug-21 06:35 PM] king of cats#9205
i just type giant paragraphs as fast as i can


[15-Aug-21 06:36 PM] king of cats#9205
but it definitely shouldn't take too long since there are only four actual problems


[15-Aug-21 06:36 PM] king of cats#9205
then i have to redo my four year plan again before i finish watching outlast 2


[15-Aug-21 06:38 PM] king of cats#9205
on a far less related note, how's sunday going for everyone?


[15-Aug-21 06:57 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
exactly thats why im procrastinating :0kittyheadbang: even tho i tell myself not to


[15-Aug-21 06:58 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
tbh im only planning by quarter because everything would go haywire if i didnt get one class i needed and i'd have to redo the plan anyways


[15-Aug-21 06:59 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
and my day's been good but also bittersweet, had a sleepover with some of my friends who are leaving in a few days so we basically said our goodbyes today :(


[15-Aug-21 06:59 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
wbu?


[15-Aug-21 07:00 PM] Viridion#0234
I tried sushi omakase for the first time üòÉ


[15-Aug-21 07:00 PM] king of cats#9205
earlier today (as in like 12 am) i finished watching outlast whistleblower so that was nice but also absolutely terrifying ahahah
otherwise it's a good day cause i'm gonna try to get my aps done fast


[15-Aug-21 07:00 PM] king of cats#9205
how was it, ethan?


[15-Aug-21 07:01 PM] Viridion#0234
Fantastic


[15-Aug-21 07:01 PM] king of cats#9205
that's goood :3


[15-Aug-21 07:01 PM] Viridion#0234
Super pricey, but definitely worth it


[15-Aug-21 07:02 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oo i dont even know specifically what that is, is it raw fish still?


[15-Aug-21 07:02 PM] Viridion#0234
The fatty tuna and wagyu were the standouts tho


[15-Aug-21 07:02 PM] Viridion#0234
Yessss really good cuts of raw fish


[15-Aug-21 07:02 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
is that horror üò© i watched the notbook yesterday but tbh i was just really done with the characters for the most part LOL oops


[15-Aug-21 07:02 PM] king of cats#9205
i think omakase is like chef's pick if i remember right


[15-Aug-21 07:03 PM] king of cats#9205
idk it came up in animal crossing


[15-Aug-21 07:03 PM] Viridion#0234
Yea chefs choice is the direct translation I believe

[15-Aug-21 07:03 PM] Viridion#0234
It was


[15-Aug-21 07:03 PM] Viridion#0234
I went to this tiny little place in an alleyway


[15-Aug-21 07:03 PM] king of cats#9205
lmfaooo i swear every drama has that moment
also yes, outlast is a horror game, i decided to watch it all before school starts


[15-Aug-21 07:03 PM] Viridion#0234
And it had a cute ambience

{Reactions}
üíõ 

[15-Aug-21 07:04 PM] king of cats#9205
oooh that sounds cool


[15-Aug-21 07:04 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i'd wanna search it but i dont even like sushi lmaoo


[15-Aug-21 07:04 PM] Viridion#0234
You WHAT


[15-Aug-21 07:04 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
üëÄ raw fish texture just isnt it


[15-Aug-21 07:05 PM] Viridion#0234
Mmm that‚Äôs fair


[15-Aug-21 07:05 PM] king of cats#9205
oh i don't eat raw fish but for a different reason


[15-Aug-21 07:05 PM] Viridion#0234
I only got into eating raw fish after I had this bomb ass poke bowl in Hawaii


[15-Aug-21 07:05 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
also i feel like the notebook is such a classic but i swear the non-consent and the cheating just made me roll my eyse so much


[15-Aug-21 07:05 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ive only tried a tiny bite of my friend's once but ehh fish also isnt my fav


[15-Aug-21 07:05 PM] king of cats#9205
i thought too hard about disney movies and now i ruined it for myself ahah


[15-Aug-21 07:06 PM] king of cats#9205
same i don't really like fish that much


[15-Aug-21 07:06 PM] king of cats#9205
i remember watching this tv show where people got parasites from eating raw fish


[15-Aug-21 07:06 PM] king of cats#9205
since then, i have never even considered raw fish worth the risk to eat


[15-Aug-21 07:06 PM] Viridion#0234
Honestly fish still isn‚Äôt my go to, but now I just like eating if it‚Äôs like specifically good


[15-Aug-21 07:06 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ahhh yeah everyone says not to think of movies logically but if it's supposed to be about life, i'll be pretty cynical haha


[15-Aug-21 07:07 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh yeah thats also sketchy but if you go to somewhere where the stuff is prepped safely it should be alright


[15-Aug-21 07:07 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
im wondering how bistro(?) sushi is tho... maybe i;ll try again if i really need to use dining dollars


[15-Aug-21 07:07 PM] Viridion#0234
I got the pricier one, I‚Äôll treat you if I have leftovers come the end of the quarter

lmaooo ethan


[15-Aug-21 07:08 PM] king of cats#9205
honestly at this point i feel like making sushi would be cheaper than buying it


[15-Aug-21 07:08 PM] king of cats#9205
but also can't drive


[15-Aug-21 07:08 PM] Viridion#0234
I sure as hell ain‚Äôt eating raw fish anywhere that doesn‚Äôt have a stellar reputation


[15-Aug-21 07:08 PM] Viridion#0234
Mood üòî


[15-Aug-21 07:11 PM] Viridion#0234
The price usually comes from having to source it from places that are like


[15-Aug-21 07:11 PM] Viridion#0234
Across the world, right


[15-Aug-21 07:12 PM] king of cats#9205
idk from what i remember it costs my mom less to go to mitsuwa to buy fish there and make sushi over going to a restaurant


[15-Aug-21 07:12 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i have the cheap one but it's literally $30 every weekday... and i assume ill use around 5-10 a day so i dont know what ill do LOL


[15-Aug-21 07:13 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
and yeah it's probably bad to be stingy with raw foods hahaha


[15-Aug-21 07:13 PM] Viridion#0234
Yeaaa I was gonna say


[15-Aug-21 07:13 PM] Viridion#0234
Not sure how much I would trust grocery store raw food


[15-Aug-21 07:13 PM] king of cats#9205
lmao


[15-Aug-21 07:14 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678

[15-Aug-21 07:15 PM] Viridion#0234

[15-Aug-21 07:17 PM] John._.#1301
bistro is actually really good. probably the most refined dining food on campus. falls a little flat of off campus sushi like Kura, but much better than gas station type sushi


[15-Aug-21 07:17 PM] Viridion#0234
forgot the actual name


[15-Aug-21 07:17 PM] king of cats#9205
lmaooooooo


[15-Aug-21 07:17 PM] Viridion#0234
but is it as bad as sfo sushi


[15-Aug-21 07:17 PM] Viridion#0234

[15-Aug-21 07:17 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678

[15-Aug-21 07:17 PM] Viridion#0234
traumatizingly bad


[15-Aug-21 07:18 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i know i can splurge on food but i just dont know what i'll want


[15-Aug-21 07:18 PM] king of cats#9205
i don't usually trust airport food ngl


[15-Aug-21 07:18 PM] Viridion#0234
theres some good airport food


[15-Aug-21 07:18 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
LOL isnt airport food always bad

[15-Aug-21 07:19 PM] king of cats#9205
usually i go to the san jose airport tbh


[15-Aug-21 07:19 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i did travel last month but im usually half asleep or nauseous when i go to the airport so i dont pay attention


[15-Aug-21 07:19 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ah i havent been there in so long


[15-Aug-21 07:20 PM] king of cats#9205
i like airplanes for whatever reason but i also usually never sleep on them ahahahah


[15-Aug-21 07:22 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i only sleep on them


[15-Aug-21 07:22 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i used to throw up 100% of the time on airplanes til late elem school years


[15-Aug-21 07:22 PM] king of cats#9205
awwwww i'm glad that's no longer the case


[15-Aug-21 07:23 PM] king of cats#9205
honestly when the plane is leaving the ground and landing are my least favorite parts


[15-Aug-21 07:23 PM] king of cats#9205
it's like riding a rollercoaster tbh


[15-Aug-21 07:58 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
im glad too i hated it sm lol


[15-Aug-21 07:58 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh yeah those are so rocky and noisy


[15-Aug-21 07:58 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i dont like it but i like rollercoasters :3


[15-Aug-21 07:59 PM] king of cats#9205
ahahah i'm so bad with rollercoasters because i don't scream, i just have an apparently very terrified expression as i cling to the friend next to me for dear life


[15-Aug-21 08:00 PM] king of cats#9205
but i get on them anyway


[15-Aug-21 08:00 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ahh i dont rly scream but if something unexpected happens, i squeak LOL no one can hear anyways over the actual screaming


[15-Aug-21 08:00 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
im apparently an adrenaline junkie so makes sense that i like it hehe


[15-Aug-21 08:01 PM] king of cats#9205
i'm just really quiet but clinging like a drowned cat


[15-Aug-21 08:01 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
also im gonna get off discord rn to focus on aps so uhh the next time i talk here i'd better be done lmao


[15-Aug-21 08:01 PM] king of cats#9205

[15-Aug-21 08:01 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678

at least it's all sushi ingredients


[15-Aug-21 08:51 PM] king of cats#9205
i've also seen a recipe for a sushi cake actually


[15-Aug-21 08:51 PM] CatFish#7990
minus the cheese and pepperoni part xD


[15-Aug-21 08:52 PM] king of cats#9205
it doesn't look like cheese ?


[15-Aug-21 08:52 PM] CatFish#7990
i think the second one is cheese lol


[15-Aug-21 08:52 PM] king of cats#9205
i don't think so, the texture just looks off for cheese lmao


[15-Aug-21 08:52 PM] CatFish#7990
actually yeah ur right lemme see if i can find the recipe


[15-Aug-21 08:52 PM] king of cats#9205

[15-Aug-21 08:53 PM] king of cats#9205

[15-Aug-21 08:59 PM] king of cats#9205
yeah i had some recipes on nyt that i want a permanent copy of


[15-Aug-21 08:59 PM] king of cats#9205
i have like 100 pages of recipes from cookbooks and stuff


[15-Aug-21 08:59 PM] king of cats#9205
it's honestly really soothing typing recipes


[15-Aug-21 09:01 PM] CatFish#7990
that sounds like a fun webscraping project lol


[15-Aug-21 09:01 PM] king of cats#9205
idk i also like spending time looking through recipes and the comments


[15-Aug-21 09:02 PM] CatFish#7990
sounds like reddit but with cooking and recipes xD


[15-Aug-21 09:05 PM] king of cats#9205
yeah most of the comments are either saying what to change to the existing recipe or that it works or that it's a massive fail


[15-Aug-21 09:05 PM] king of cats#9205
quite helpful ngl


[15-Aug-21 09:05 PM] king of cats#9205
but usually when i have to type recipes it's because it's a physical book


[15-Aug-21 09:05 PM] CatFish#7990
o makes sense


[15-Aug-21 09:06 PM] CatFish#7990
welp glhf


[15-Aug-21 09:06 PM] ferreti#0348
could scan the pages and digitally mark them up?


[15-Aug-21 09:09 PM] king of cats#9205
but that makes it less funnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn


[15-Aug-21 09:09 PM] king of cats#9205
i like typing it


[15-Aug-21 09:09 PM] king of cats#9205

[15-Aug-21 10:22 PM] SilverAsh#5707
tuna is really good when done well but you cant have too much of it


[15-Aug-21 10:22 PM] SilverAsh#5707
mercury and other things accumulate cause tuna is high in the food chain


[15-Aug-21 10:22 PM] ferreti#0348

For my summer program final project, I want to design a better version of when2meet.com. To do so, I need to figure out what to improve. This should only take three minutes at most.

@Cinnamon Bun i understand how you feel now having to push things back b/c of precalc
my sleep deprived brain didn't realize last week that i might have to take four more math classes so now i'm looking at seven math classes aaaaaaaaa


[17-Aug-21 11:07 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
Ha ha ha ha

[17-Aug-21 11:08 PM] king of cats#9205
i have to take 20A-E and then 18 and then 180A at the moment


[17-Aug-21 11:08 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
Aww


[17-Aug-21 11:08 PM] king of cats#9205
but i did ask in a different server if it's absolutely necessary


[17-Aug-21 11:08 PM] king of cats#9205
i would like to just take 20A, 20B, and 18 in the ideal situation


[17-Aug-21 11:10 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
Yeahhh


[17-Aug-21 11:10 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652

bro im just like üòÉ


[17-Aug-21 11:12 PM] king of cats#9205
i am genuinely curious as to how everyone else is going to handle the cogs 118 stuff


[17-Aug-21 11:13 PM] alexavndra#4425
we just gonna handle it


[17-Aug-21 11:13 PM] king of cats#9205
the 118 reqs are weird


[17-Aug-21 11:13 PM] king of cats#9205
like grad reqs don't say you have to take that much math


[17-Aug-21 11:13 PM] king of cats#9205
but then you still do?

hi jennyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy


[17-Aug-21 11:15 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i was, until i saw the math reqs :') thats why i wanted to do d&i instead lolll


[17-Aug-21 11:15 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
helloo!!


[17-Aug-21 11:16 PM] king of cats#9205
smart smart


[17-Aug-21 11:17 PM] king of cats#9205
i didn't want to replan so my backup plan is if i cannot pawsibly convince the professors for 118B and 118D to let me take two less math classes, is probably going to either be changing specializations or just getting my b.s. with no specialization


[17-Aug-21 11:17 PM] alexavndra#4425
ooh fr fr


[17-Aug-21 11:18 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ah wait i assume you would probably be done in less than 3 years if you didn't do machine learning


[17-Aug-21 11:18 PM] king of cats#9205
the only reason i even need math 20e & 180A is for that one req for the two mandatory cogsci 118A/B/C/D courses


[17-Aug-21 11:18 PM] king of cats#9205
maybe? idk i planned in a potential cs minor when i was doing it


[17-Aug-21 11:18 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh yeah i saw it and i just didnt want to relearn calculus to take cde and 180a


[17-Aug-21 11:19 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
mhm thats why i might try for a minor instead of doing ml


[17-Aug-21 11:19 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
no extra math!


[17-Aug-21 11:19 PM] king of cats#9205
but now my seven or more math classes will probably be keeping me stressed and occupied ahahah


[17-Aug-21 11:19 PM] king of cats#9205
i mean i saw that cs majors also have a bunch of math


[17-Aug-21 11:19 PM] king of cats#9205
but i also feel like a lot of them got more math waived than i did


[17-Aug-21 11:19 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
they do, but the minor doesnt seem to require it


[17-Aug-21 11:19 PM] king of cats#9205
i literally just have calc 10a waived


[17-Aug-21 11:19 PM] king of cats#9205
LOVE THAT


[17-Aug-21 11:19 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
at least if you dont take upper div classes that req it


[17-Aug-21 11:20 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
exactly üò© i guess it depends on if you want more cs classes or a mixture of cs and math tho lol


[17-Aug-21 11:20 PM] alexavndra#4425
same with the minor


[17-Aug-21 11:20 PM] king of cats#9205
i'm going to assume i can graduate in 4 years since ucsd did admit me and all


[17-Aug-21 11:20 PM] alexavndra#4425
same HAHAH


[17-Aug-21 11:20 PM] king of cats#9205
but still i'm giving them my squintiest of squinty eyes


[17-Aug-21 11:21 PM] king of cats#9205
i swear it's so convenient having that minor and doing the ml specialization


[17-Aug-21 11:21 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
you have a lot of credits and people with none can usually still grad in 4 years if they work hard enough


[17-Aug-21 11:21 PM] king of cats#9205
imagine if i have to take math over summer


[17-Aug-21 11:21 PM] king of cats#9205
i will cry


[17-Aug-21 11:21 PM] alexavndra#4425
no cus fr lmaooo


[17-Aug-21 11:22 PM] king of cats#9205
if everything works out nicely then it would be so easy to complete the minor ahahah


[17-Aug-21 11:22 PM] king of cats#9205
but how are they doing it is the real question. like what if they're doing full loads every quarter including summer -0-


[17-Aug-21 11:23 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh my that seems way too much... i assume that'd only happen if they cant get the classes they need multiple times and end up taking other stuff


[17-Aug-21 11:23 PM] king of cats#9205
i mean next summer i have to take spanish so i don't have to take it during the year


[17-Aug-21 11:23 PM] king of cats#9205
i have to take around seven math classes


[17-Aug-21 11:23 PM] king of cats#9205
plus everything else


[17-Aug-21 11:23 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ugh the cs classes will be brutal to try to get into i assume (for the minor)


[17-Aug-21 11:23 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
afjfbfafai good luck


[17-Aug-21 11:23 PM] king of cats#9205
maybe? idk


[17-Aug-21 11:23 PM] king of cats#9205
i won't worry too much about that


[17-Aug-21 11:23 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
best case scenario i only have one more MATH course (but there are still cs/cogs courses about math im nto counting)


[17-Aug-21 11:24 PM] king of cats#9205
i'm more concerned about graduating in four years ahahahah


[17-Aug-21 11:24 PM] king of cats#9205
niceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee


[17-Aug-21 11:24 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
im sure you can do it you have so many credits!


[17-Aug-21 11:24 PM] king of cats#9205
a lot of my credits are general elective credits so they count for nothing that i'm aware of lmfao


[17-Aug-21 11:24 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
for me, best case scenario right now i could grad in 3 years if i wanted to (4 per quarter no summer) but i also dont want to rush college


[17-Aug-21 11:24 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ohh


[17-Aug-21 11:25 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
well enrollment will be good for you :3


[17-Aug-21 11:25 PM] king of cats#9205
i have 32 units of electives that aren't upper division


[17-Aug-21 11:25 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
wait are your other units upper div? or fulfilling GEs


[17-Aug-21 11:26 PM] king of cats#9205
they're mainly ges


[17-Aug-21 11:26 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i remember you had a pretty high number of units so that actually seems like a lot fulfilling ge's


[17-Aug-21 11:27 PM] king of cats#9205
yeah i have like three left


[17-Aug-21 11:27 PM] king of cats#9205
but i'm freaked out over all the lower division reqs i have before i can take some of my upper division courses


[17-Aug-21 11:27 PM] alexavndra#4425
oh wait aerin are you in revelle yeah


[17-Aug-21 11:27 PM] king of cats#9205

[17-Aug-21 11:27 PM] alexavndra#4425
ooh okay


[17-Aug-21 11:28 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
youre actually really ahead then! even with those math classes i would assume you can grad in 4 years


[17-Aug-21 11:28 PM] king of cats#9205
ahahaha i hope so


[17-Aug-21 11:29 PM] king of cats#9205

but theres a lot of freedom when it comes to uppe div electives so i'll probably only look at those starting next eyar


[17-Aug-21 11:36 PM] king of cats#9205
pretty much once i finish planning, it'll be past the point of no return

[17-Aug-21 11:56 PM] king of cats#9205

[17-Aug-21 11:56 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
omg yeah the designy art ones always have portfolio reqs that make me go o.o


[17-Aug-21 11:57 PM] king of cats#9205

[17-Aug-21 11:57 PM] king of cats#9205

i dont know a thing about design and im not creative


[17-Aug-21 11:59 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
but i know its a popular specialization lolll


[18-Aug-21 12:00 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
tbh the clinical one sounds more interesting to me but i dont know what id use it for


[18-Aug-21 12:00 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
I‚Äôm just confused because I know I wouldn‚Äôt move it out of my room and I can‚Äôt find it xD


[18-Aug-21 12:00 AM] king of cats#9205
i think the best way to put it is that design specialization usually ends with people in the ux/ui design field as far as i‚Äôm aware


[18-Aug-21 12:00 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
I‚Äôd like to think I‚Äôm organized ‚Ä¶


[18-Aug-21 12:00 AM] king of cats#9205

[18-Aug-21 12:00 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652

you should only have one?


[18-Aug-21 12:07 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652

[18-Aug-21 12:08 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
We took the pixels every other one


[18-Aug-21 12:08 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
Like the directions said


[18-Aug-21 12:08 AM] king of cats#9205
wait what


[18-Aug-21 12:08 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
And put it in a smaller area


[18-Aug-21 12:08 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678

i think no matter the image size, it displays the same way


[18-Aug-21 12:10 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
thats why its blurrierer


[18-Aug-21 12:10 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678

I take notes to stay awake but if I get sleepy I can tune stuff out and stare into space


[18-Aug-21 12:20 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
Then I come back and get confused


[18-Aug-21 12:20 AM] lyd#9524

[18-Aug-21 12:20 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652

Even the end of APS I was struggling


[18-Aug-21 12:20 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678

[18-Aug-21 12:20 AM] king of cats#9205
lmao jenny


[18-Aug-21 12:20 AM] king of cats#9205
you just named something other than pygame that we learned


[18-Aug-21 12:20 AM] king of cats#9205
sorting


[18-Aug-21 12:20 AM] lyd#9524
then i went in and out of pygame


[18-Aug-21 12:20 AM] lyd#9524

[18-Aug-21 12:20 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678

[18-Aug-21 12:21 AM] king of cats#9205
pygame feels like scratch


[18-Aug-21 12:21 AM] king of cats#9205
but harder


[18-Aug-21 12:21 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
im so confuesd my brainnn


[18-Aug-21 12:21 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678

[18-Aug-21 12:21 AM] king of cats#9205
i'm honestly just learning from the labs


[18-Aug-21 12:21 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678

[18-Aug-21 12:21 AM] lyd#9524

[18-Aug-21 12:21 AM] lyd#9524
same


[18-Aug-21 12:21 AM] king of cats#9205
i feel like doing it is easier than actually learning it from lecture


[18-Aug-21 12:21 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
The labs are nice snd I like how they introduce the concept snd show you the fundamentals


[18-Aug-21 12:21 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i think i "focused" better in that one bc i was actually trying to type the code he was showing so i had to not space out


[18-Aug-21 12:21 AM] lyd#9524
yeaa it is bc my attention span is worse than a goldfish


[18-Aug-21 12:21 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
The lectures are nice


[18-Aug-21 12:22 AM] lyd#9524
also i should move around the house instead of being in one place all day


[18-Aug-21 12:22 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652

[18-Aug-21 12:22 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652

[18-Aug-21 12:22 AM] king of cats#9205

[18-Aug-21 12:22 AM] lyd#9524

[18-Aug-21 12:23 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
Idk how to tell how much


[18-Aug-21 12:23 AM] king of cats#9205
i used to go to art museums a lot and just outdoors stuff


[18-Aug-21 12:23 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i used to be able to stand for a while bc 3 hrs of choir or more and i was always fine lol


[18-Aug-21 12:24 AM] king of cats#9205
and my mom always insisted on walking for hours upon hours upon hours


[18-Aug-21 12:24 AM] king of cats#9205
so at this point it would be weird if i couldn't tolerate a lot of walking


[18-Aug-21 12:24 AM] lyd#9524
oo


[18-Aug-21 12:24 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678

[18-Aug-21 12:26 AM] king of cats#9205
the last time i walked a bunch was august cause my friend and i were hanging out before they moved


[18-Aug-21 12:27 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
There are two parking lots at Disneyland, the 20 dollar one and the expensive one


[18-Aug-21 12:27 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
I parked in the tram 20 dollar one. My friends and I were at Disney all day snd then I was exausted and wanted to sleep


[18-Aug-21 12:27 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
So they took my hand and took me to where they thought the parking lot is


[18-Aug-21 12:27 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
These two parking lots are like a mile apart I swear


[18-Aug-21 12:27 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh no


[18-Aug-21 12:27 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
So we walk down to the expensive parking lot it takes like 20 minutes


[18-Aug-21 12:28 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
And my friends realize it‚Äôs the wrong area!


[18-Aug-21 12:28 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
And I was like; dragging my feet tired cause I have to drive us back to the hotel


[18-Aug-21 12:28 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
And so my friends ask where the other parking lot is and we get told it‚Äôs on the opposite side of the park so we have to go all the way back


[18-Aug-21 12:29 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
It‚Äôs like 11:40 PM at this point and I‚Äôm wearing this back pack so I lock it on and just make a beeline to the tram


[18-Aug-21 12:29 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
I just ran all the way over there with my friends behind me


[18-Aug-21 12:29 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
That‚Äôs why I think I took so many steps


[18-Aug-21 12:29 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
But we got to the hotel at like 1 AM


[18-Aug-21 12:29 AM] ferreti#0348
jeez :((


[18-Aug-21 12:29 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
So that was nice


[18-Aug-21 12:29 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
I can laugh about it now XD


[18-Aug-21 12:29 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
But at the time I was gonna pass out


[18-Aug-21 12:30 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
wow i would probably have collapsed and given up at the wrong parking lot lmaoo


[18-Aug-21 12:30 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
wooo exercise ü•¥ but literally its too late for that


[18-Aug-21 12:30 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
It was a 40 minute walk to the parking lot in the dark if we missed the tram


[18-Aug-21 12:30 AM] king of cats#9205
oh wowwwww


[18-Aug-21 12:30 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
So I wanted to run and make sure we were safe and able to get back


[18-Aug-21 12:30 AM] king of cats#9205
i think the most i ever walked was around 18k steps sooo


[18-Aug-21 12:30 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652

i always say that lol but when i see it drop i know ill hate it

as long as i have a 3.0 i'm happy


[18-Aug-21 12:37 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
I feel like I‚Äôve always been an honor student so I don‚Äôt know what to do with myself


[18-Aug-21 12:37 AM] king of cats#9205
i'm not expecting myself to really be just peachy


[18-Aug-21 12:38 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
That‚Äôs a healthy mindset


[18-Aug-21 12:38 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i dont expect to be because i always have a pessimistic mindset for myself


[18-Aug-21 12:38 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
I tend to get sad when my grade goes down


[18-Aug-21 12:38 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
but when it actualyl comes to it i still get annoyed


[18-Aug-21 12:38 AM] king of cats#9205
honestly i think the correct response is to kinda just let go of all the honor student stuff if it starts wrecking your mental health and stuff


[18-Aug-21 12:38 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
That‚Äôs true


[18-Aug-21 12:39 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
yes yourself is >>>>


[18-Aug-21 12:39 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
I just find it harder to stop mental stuff than physical


[18-Aug-21 12:39 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
Like I didn‚Äôt do AP stuff cause it physically hurt me XD


[18-Aug-21 12:39 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
But I can‚Äôt stop the honors mentality cause my brain is reee


[18-Aug-21 12:39 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
In short it hurts to write


[18-Aug-21 12:39 AM] king of cats#9205
honestly i think mental pain and trauma and stuff really comes back to haunt big time


[18-Aug-21 12:39 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
My wrist is funky


[18-Aug-21 12:39 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652

[18-Aug-21 12:41 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
The doctors don‚Äôt really have a name for it but they know it‚Äôs appearing in young women who get stressed about school and have perfectionism stuff


[18-Aug-21 12:41 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
Uh not necessarily


[18-Aug-21 12:41 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
Basically


[18-Aug-21 12:42 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
My brain reads stress as danger and threat and to protect myself it causes me to be in pain


[18-Aug-21 12:42 AM] king of cats#9205
ohhh i think i've heard of that before


[18-Aug-21 12:42 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
I had tendinitis for a while and was really stressed at school so I overworked myself too much and that‚Äôs what we think caused the bad loop


[18-Aug-21 12:42 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652

[18-Aug-21 12:42 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678

[18-Aug-21 12:42 AM] king of cats#9205

[18-Aug-21 12:43 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
I did acupuncture, physical therapy, laser therapy, cortisone shot, dipping my arm in hot wax. It was crazy.


[18-Aug-21 12:43 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
Yeah I had that and fluid build ups


[18-Aug-21 12:43 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
well your brain does try to protect you but that seems hard is there a way to fix it???


[18-Aug-21 12:43 AM] king of cats#9205
i hope you're taking better care of yourself now!!! :3


[18-Aug-21 12:43 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
The doctors didn‚Äôt know what was wrong so they put me in a brace and I lost muscle cause I wasn‚Äôt using my wrist


[18-Aug-21 12:43 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
Yes! I try to help minimize stress and I do therapy stuff


[18-Aug-21 12:43 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652

but it was pretty fun meeting the cog sci people


[18-Aug-21 05:36 PM] king of cats#9205
i've been doing my four year planning and one thing i've been doing besides the spreadsheet ucsd has is making a google doc checklist that i'm probably going to print out so if anyone else is really struggling to track grad reqs, would suggest that + checking degree audit
ALSO weird thing i noticed with mainly cog sci is that some prereqs are easy to miss because they don't separate the "ands" and "ors" which is trippy (like sometimes you can pick one class that fulfills a certain preq but there aren't clear distinctions on the course catalog whereas if you look at cse they put parentheses around each prereq and its other options if it has any) and it caused me to miss a few the first go although i feel like my sleep deprivation had a role in it too

Yes newton that means u should go to webreg and click the enroll button now !


[20-Aug-21 05:09 PM] crossboy#7777
That's the priority system!


[20-Aug-21 05:09 PM] king of cats#9205
honestly i'm semi confused by the priority system (not the cse aspect but the other parts)


[20-Aug-21 05:10 PM] king of cats#9205
how important is standing?


[20-Aug-21 05:11 PM] crossboy#7777
definitey still important


[20-Aug-21 05:11 PM] crossboy#7777
you can kinda think of it like this


[20-Aug-21 05:12 PM] crossboy#7777
imagine that the course was CSE major restricted at first (or anyone else who has priority)


[20-Aug-21 05:12 PM] crossboy#7777
then after all the CSE majors get in (/other priorities), it becomes open to all


[20-Aug-21 05:12 PM] crossboy#7777
that's basically what happens, it's just it all happens behind the scenes with the waitlist


[20-Aug-21 05:12 PM] crossboy#7777
so the order you get into the waitlist still matters, because that's what decides which priorities get in first


[20-Aug-21 05:13 PM] king of cats#9205
ohhhhhh


[20-Aug-21 05:14 PM] crossboy#7777
they basically go through the waitlist and check "are they a priority? if so, send the email. if not, go to the next one". once all the majors have gotten in (or their time has passed), then just open up the class and all the people on the waitlist get let in regularly

[20-Aug-21 05:16 PM] king of cats#9205
so if i'm a freshman with junior standing does that do anything to my enrollment times or something


[20-Aug-21 05:17 PM] king of cats#9205
aside from the fact i can register for upper division courses that require a junior standing


[20-Aug-21 05:18 PM] king of cats#9205
actually


[20-Aug-21 05:18 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i think after this, youll have the earliest enrollment times for our class because its by units


[20-Aug-21 05:18 PM] king of cats#9205
ohhhhhh


[20-Aug-21 05:18 PM] king of cats#9205
that's nice


[20-Aug-21 05:18 PM] king of cats#9205
this quarter is going to be interesting for me ig


[20-Aug-21 05:19 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
yeahh i dont think theyll actually put you with juniors but its an earlier times for freshmen??


[20-Aug-21 05:19 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ah did you finish making your sched?


[20-Aug-21 05:20 PM] king of cats#9205
i'm on waitlist for two cognitive science lower division courses


[20-Aug-21 05:20 PM] king of cats#9205
so if that doesn't work out


[20-Aug-21 05:20 PM] king of cats#9205
i'll be taking upper division elective courses that have space with my junior standing lmfao


[20-Aug-21 05:20 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh wow that would be interesting for your first quarter lmao


[20-Aug-21 05:21 PM] king of cats#9205
yeah and it would mainly be the fault of my enrollment time lmfao


[20-Aug-21 05:22 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
yeahh im glad that from now on there'll be the pass system


[20-Aug-21 05:22 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
and hopefully not many people have as many units as you ahahah


[20-Aug-21 05:27 PM] king of cats#9205
oml that would suck


[20-Aug-21 05:27 PM] king of cats#9205
then i'd go back to having practically nothing to do/take ahahah


[20-Aug-21 05:32 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i really doubt it ive never heard of a junior standing freshman lmaoo


[20-Aug-21 05:37 PM] king of cats#9205
lmaooo idk most of the students i know are junior standing freshmen


[20-Aug-21 05:37 PM] king of cats#9205
but from what i remember, a lot of y'all are sophomore standing freshmen, right?


[20-Aug-21 05:38 PM] Viridion#0234
how do you hceck


[20-Aug-21 05:38 PM] king of cats#9205
the major minor area


[20-Aug-21 05:38 PM] king of cats#9205
it's open now so you can change majors and stuff


[20-Aug-21 05:39 PM] loshy#1738
my tritonlink


[20-Aug-21 05:39 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
90+ units is junior


[20-Aug-21 05:40 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i heard that for bay area sophomore standing is typical, but a lot of the ap creds dont actually count for stuff and it only helps w enrollment times


[20-Aug-21 05:43 PM] king of cats#9205
ohhhhhhh that's interestinggggggg


[20-Aug-21 05:45 PM] Younus#8307
what does this mean


[20-Aug-21 05:46 PM] crossboy#7777
sorry only just got here


[20-Aug-21 05:46 PM] crossboy#7777
or just checked here again i mean


[20-Aug-21 05:48 PM] crossboy#7777
@jennosaur‚ô° / @king of cats - correct! standing contributes to your enrollment time. but it's not just unit based (i.e. highest units goes first), but rather just the standing. so all people with priority enrollment get a randomized time together, then all the seniors, then all the juniors, then all the sophmores, then all the freshmen.

[20-Aug-21 05:57 PM] king of cats#9205
does that mean i'm a senior next year, that will be so weird


[20-Aug-21 06:00 PM] king of cats#9205
3 years of being a senior??? lmfao


[20-Aug-21 06:00 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i guess if you get the credits!! lol i think you dont have to worry about taking more than 4 yrs to graduate then probably


[20-Aug-21 06:00 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
thats sos strange ahahaah


[20-Aug-21 06:00 PM] king of cats#9205

[20-Aug-21 06:05 PM] ferreti#0348

[20-Aug-21 06:06 PM] king of cats#9205

[20-Aug-21 06:06 PM] king of cats#9205
it would just be really funny and weird seeing senior for three years


[20-Aug-21 06:09 PM] diegom1#3882
Yea that's how it's probably gonna be lol


[20-Aug-21 06:10 PM] diegom1#3882
Shout-out to my highschool for making me take useless ap classes


[20-Aug-21 06:10 PM] diegom1#3882
Wish I would've done community college


[20-Aug-21 06:10 PM] king of cats#9205
i know the route i took isn't that popular ngl


[20-Aug-21 06:11 PM] king of cats#9205
mainly cause your social life gets really wrecked from it


[20-Aug-21 07:01 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ahh middle college seems to not be too well known? could you still have a "normal" social life if you wanted tho


[20-Aug-21 07:03 PM] king of cats#9205
yeah it's just really hard to do lmao


[20-Aug-21 07:03 PM] king of cats#9205
most of the time the schedules don't align plus you kinda get out of the loop w/ school activities if you don't try hard enough to keep up with them


[20-Aug-21 07:05 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ahh yeah and you dont always have classes at normal times right?


[20-Aug-21 07:05 PM] king of cats#9205
yeah!!!


[20-Aug-21 07:08 PM] king of cats#9205
do any of y'all play identity v? i'm going to play that if anyone else wants to join myself and some of my friends from my guild lmao


[20-Aug-21 07:22 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
What is that?


[20-Aug-21 07:23 PM] king of cats#9205
it's a multiplayer game on mobile phones


[20-Aug-21 07:24 PM] king of cats#9205
the game is a lot like hide & seek except the seeker is dangerous


[20-Aug-21 07:26 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oo sounds like dead by daylight kinda lol


[20-Aug-21 07:26 PM] king of cats#9205
i think it might be???


[20-Aug-21 07:27 PM] king of cats#9205
so i googled it and yes it is like dead by daylight


[20-Aug-21 07:31 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
@crossboy


[20-Aug-21 07:31 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652

[20-Aug-21 07:33 PM] king of cats#9205
you could get a wheelchair?


[20-Aug-21 07:34 PM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
I see you getting those gains. *I don‚Äôt know if people actually say that. You should stretch and take care of yourself!*


[20-Aug-21 07:34 PM] king of cats#9205
yes stretches are importantttt


[20-Aug-21 07:35 PM] diegom1#3882
Yea gonna stretch from now on lmao too much pain


[20-Aug-21 08:31 PM] vikkstar#1233
How many credits is considered sophomore standing?


[20-Aug-21 08:32 PM] king of cats#9205
i think 45 units completed


[20-Aug-21 08:32 PM] king of cats#9205
cause there's a minimum of 180 and divide it by four and it's 45


[20-Aug-21 08:32 PM] king of cats#9205
i have 90 and i'm at junior


[20-Aug-21 08:32 PM] king of cats#9205
so i think it's right??


[20-Aug-21 08:32 PM] vikkstar#1233
hmm it says I have 48 units but says im a freshman


[20-Aug-21 08:32 PM] alexavndra#4425
i have 50 and im a soph


[20-Aug-21 08:32 PM] John._.#1301

[20-Aug-21 08:32 PM] king of cats#9205
lmao mine is college credit ahah i only took 1 ap class ever


[20-Aug-21 08:33 PM] alexavndra#4425
was it worth it? maybe


[20-Aug-21 08:34 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i dont see why standing would be different for other colleges tho


[20-Aug-21 08:34 PM] alexavndra#4425
true true


[20-Aug-21 08:34 PM] alexavndra#4425
idk honestly it's lowk confusing lmao


[20-Aug-21 08:35 PM] vikkstar#1233
yeah idk on my degree audit it says i have 48 credits


[20-Aug-21 08:35 PM] Chubach#2231
My college classes each were worth 6 units so they were pretty helpful


[20-Aug-21 08:36 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
Freshman: 0 - 44.9

Sophomore: 45 - 89.9

Junior: 90 - 134.9

Senior: 135+


[20-Aug-21 08:37 PM] vikkstar#1233
elective credits count in that right?


[20-Aug-21 08:37 PM] vikkstar#1233
cause some of my ap credit went into elective credit


[20-Aug-21 08:37 PM] king of cats#9205
yep they do


[20-Aug-21 08:38 PM] king of cats#9205
i have 30.5 units in elective cred


[20-Aug-21 08:38 PM] king of cats#9205
you might wanna call the registrar if you're unsure


[20-Aug-21 08:38 PM] alexavndra#4425
i have 42 in elect


[20-Aug-21 08:38 PM] king of cats#9205
i called them and they told me my thingy


[20-Aug-21 08:38 PM] alexavndra#4425
so that makes 8 fr class creds


[20-Aug-21 08:38 PM] vikkstar#1233
yeah i might just wait till we're on campus


[20-Aug-21 08:38 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
yeah a lot of ap credit doesnt actually help with grad reqs


[20-Aug-21 08:40 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678

[20-Aug-21 08:41 PM] vikkstar#1233

usually around 50-70


[20-Aug-21 09:09 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
ohhh do they actually pay attention to if students use it


[20-Aug-21 09:15 PM] king of cats#9205
i mean most college wifi networks can see what you're browsing to start??


[20-Aug-21 11:18 PM] crossboy#7777
university wifi does track what you do, but only for legal reasons


[20-Aug-21 11:18 PM] crossboy#7777
i.e. they don't actually look through what you're doing


[20-Aug-21 11:18 PM] crossboy#7777
the only reason they look at it is if they get a report from someone saying your'e doing something illegal on their wifi


[20-Aug-21 11:18 PM] crossboy#7777
then they have to


[20-Aug-21 11:22 PM] king of cats#9205
oh that's quite interesting


[20-Aug-21 11:22 PM] king of cats#9205

[22-Aug-21 11:52 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh how long do they usually take?


[22-Aug-21 11:53 PM] king of cats#9205
5 minutes?


[22-Aug-21 11:53 PM] king of cats#9205
idk


[22-Aug-21 11:53 PM] king of cats#9205
i'm entering one rn


[22-Aug-21 11:53 PM] king of cats#9205
we'll see how fast it takes me to die


[22-Aug-21 11:53 PM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh gosh if it's that short, how does it dran your battery so much


[22-Aug-21 11:58 PM] king of cats#9205
okay that round was exactly 5 minutes


[22-Aug-21 11:58 PM] king of cats#9205
but i usually play back to back rounds


[22-Aug-21 11:59 PM] ferreti#0348
have you tried closing all of the background appsv


[22-Aug-21 11:59 PM] king of cats#9205
and then if i'm teamed i feel bad ditching my teammate so i end up staying way too long


[22-Aug-21 11:59 PM] king of cats#9205
i usually only run have a few?


[22-Aug-21 11:59 PM] king of cats#9205
like three


[22-Aug-21 11:59 PM] king of cats#9205
idv is apparently just a big game to be running


[22-Aug-21 11:59 PM] king of cats#9205
not as bad as genshin or a webtoon game i used to play though


[22-Aug-21 11:59 PM] king of cats#9205
genshin made my phone burn up with just loading lmfao


[23-Aug-21 12:01 AM] ferreti#0348
yike phone weak


[23-Aug-21 12:01 AM] king of cats#9205
lmaoooooooooo


[23-Aug-21 12:01 AM] king of cats#9205
i think it probably didn't help that i was playing a lot for the event as well


[23-Aug-21 12:02 AM] king of cats#9205
but it's fine cause i'm at home and i can always charge my phone :3


[23-Aug-21 12:04 AM] Viridion#0234
Boooo


[23-Aug-21 12:04 AM] king of cats#9205
well i didn't delete it over that


[23-Aug-21 12:05 AM] king of cats#9205
there was a webtoon game that made my phone heat up within a minute of me playing for whatever reason and i kept it for a few weeks before i got bored


[23-Aug-21 12:05 AM] king of cats#9205
i quit genshin cause i died 20 times over one tiny mission


[23-Aug-21 12:07 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
oh thats so bad lol


[23-Aug-21 12:07 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i think i tried to download genshin


[23-Aug-21 12:07 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
and it never worked so i never played


[23-Aug-21 12:08 AM] king of cats#9205
ahahah no i died on one of those beginner missions 20 times and just kinda went "y'know what...." and uninstalled


[23-Aug-21 12:10 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
why are those difficult tho


[23-Aug-21 12:10 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
whenever i start a new game i swear half the time i have to ask frinds for help on the tutorial


[23-Aug-21 12:11 AM] king of cats#9205
idv's tutorial wasn't hard, it was just painful ngl


[23-Aug-21 12:11 AM] king of cats#9205
there were 14 or 15 different parts to the whole thing, literal pain


[23-Aug-21 12:11 AM] king of cats#9205
but fr sometimes the tutorials are even more confusing than the actual game


[23-Aug-21 12:12 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
thats so mcuh lmaooo


[23-Aug-21 12:12 AM] jennosaur‚ô°#5678
i wouldnt know bc i give up half the time ahahahaa


[23-Aug-21 12:13 AM] king of cats#9205
i think the 15 parts was to kind of make sure everyone can actually play properly, which is fair because idv is kinda hard without tutorial handholding

[23-Aug-21 12:14 AM] king of cats#9205
join usssssssssssssssss


[23-Aug-21 12:14 AM] king of cats#9205
i only recently learned that people can play idv on pc and i was so shook


[23-Aug-21 12:14 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
What‚Äôs IDV


[23-Aug-21 12:15 AM] king of cats#9205
identity v, it's like the mobile phone version of dead by daylight that's free and owned by a chinese company and semi-translated


[23-Aug-21 12:15 AM] king of cats#9205
and by semi-translated i mean sometimes you see the errant chinese characters in aspects of the game


[23-Aug-21 12:16 AM] king of cats#9205
all the characters also look like they're from coraline!!!


[23-Aug-21 12:16 AM] king of cats#9205
and i currently have 90 friends despite downloading the game only around 3 days or so ago


[23-Aug-21 12:16 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
Oh with the eyeballs gone


[23-Aug-21 12:16 AM] Cinnamon Bun#6652
XD that‚Äôs so many


[23-Aug-21 12:16 AM] king of cats#9205
yeah!! most of them have button eyes


[23-Aug-21 12:17 AM] king of cats#9205
except the hunters who according to my brother, are the equivalent of dbd's killers


[23-Aug-21 12:18 AM] king of cats#9205
i never played dbd but my brother seems to think it's about the same as playing the mobile version of the game since ig the characters have a lot of crossover??


[23-Aug-21 12:18 AM] ferreti#0348
no wonder your phone is overheating


[23-Aug-21 12:19 AM] king of cats#9205
