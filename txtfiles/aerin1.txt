ahahahah thank you, i'll try not to snooze :p


[01-Aug-21 06:35 PM] kingofcats#9205
early classes suck when they're in person because when it's morning during like winter, it's cold
and if it's online, it's so easy to sleep through lmfao


[02-Aug-21 07:48 AM] kingofcats#9205

[06-Aug-21 10:48 PM] kingofcats#9205

[06-Aug-21 10:53 PM] kingofcats#9205
i had a few old classmates who went from my elementary


[06-Aug-21 10:53 PM] kingofcats#9205
& then i had a childhood friend


[06-Aug-21 10:53 PM] kingofcats#9205
weird i actually forgot their names


[06-Aug-21 10:53 PM] kingofcats#9205
i just know that they went to lynbrook ahahah


[06-Aug-21 10:54 PM] kingofcats#9205
but my childhood friend was the quarterback


[06-Aug-21 10:54 PM] kingofcats#9205
that's what i remember my mom telling me that his mom told her


[06-Aug-21 10:54 PM] kingofcats#9205
ahahahaha ours too


[06-Aug-21 10:54 PM] kingofcats#9205
legit we only started winning once our team dropped like 1 or two leagues


[06-Aug-21 10:55 PM] kingofcats#9205
the only good sports we have are like swimming and maybe cross country and track


[06-Aug-21 10:55 PM] kingofcats#9205
lmaooooo


[06-Aug-21 10:55 PM] kingofcats#9205
i played sports for 2 years to get out of pe my second year


[06-Aug-21 10:55 PM] kingofcats#9205
can't relate


[06-Aug-21 10:56 PM] kingofcats#9205
i remember trying cross country in 6th grade, finding out it was long distance and promising myself i'd never torture myself like that again


[06-Aug-21 10:56 PM] kingofcats#9205
then i did it again in sophomore year


[06-Aug-21 10:56 PM] kingofcats#9205
we had a pe teacher who hated guys for whatever reason


[06-Aug-21 10:57 PM] kingofcats#9205
my pe teacher was pregnant and the sub liked me which meant i was tortured

[06-Aug-21 11:01 PM] kingofcats#9205
lmaoooo one of my friends was like that


[06-Aug-21 11:01 PM] kingofcats#9205

{Reactions}

[06-Aug-21 11:01 PM] kingofcats#9205
so full story?


[06-Aug-21 11:02 PM] kingofcats#9205
so only like this may our school came under massive fire online about how they kept mishandling sexual harassment at school


[06-Aug-21 11:03 PM] kingofcats#9205
a lot of people were calling out the school for not doing anything like my friend knew this dude dating a middle schooler


[06-Aug-21 11:03 PM] kingofcats#9205
and then my school had plenty of evidence that me and like two other girls at the school dated an abusive creep who should not have been allowed back on campus


[06-Aug-21 11:03 PM] kingofcats#9205
but funny thing was that when i reached out to the school and was like hi this guy is a danger to students at the school


[06-Aug-21 11:04 PM] kingofcats#9205
they ignored the email and the person in charge of handling it yelled at the youngest person involved


[06-Aug-21 11:04 PM] kingofcats#9205
said something like i should not have contacted them about the issue with the guy


[06-Aug-21 11:04 PM] kingofcats#9205
and so i escalated it to the district and emailed the superintendent


[06-Aug-21 11:04 PM] kingofcats#9205
caused a whole emergency meeting at my high school and then nothing happened


[06-Aug-21 11:05 PM] kingofcats#9205
he graduated like nothing happened


[06-Aug-21 11:05 PM] kingofcats#9205
i saw him at the awards


[06-Aug-21 11:05 PM] kingofcats#9205
there were a bunch of complaints against other students as well that apparently the school did nothing about


[06-Aug-21 11:06 PM] kingofcats#9205
the only time school actually did something was when there was a case on campus where they had a bunch of people who took videos or something on snapchat cause it was in the bathrooms at school


[06-Aug-21 11:06 PM] kingofcats#9205
but idk it's a public school


[06-Aug-21 11:07 PM] kingofcats#9205
oh it was a sexual assault thing


[06-Aug-21 11:07 PM] kingofcats#9205
i guess some people recorded it


[06-Aug-21 11:07 PM] kingofcats#9205
the most recent picture of our school, and i'm not kidding, is literally from a mercury news article about our school having a jv soccer coach who dated a student


[06-Aug-21 11:08 PM] kingofcats#9205
i think there's no reputation left


[06-Aug-21 11:08 PM] kingofcats#9205
ew there was a guy like that in my grade who apparently sent a bunch of girls unsolicited pictures during freshman year


[06-Aug-21 11:09 PM] kingofcats#9205
they just cover their eyes


[06-Aug-21 11:09 PM] kingofcats#9205
and run


[06-Aug-21 11:09 PM] kingofcats#9205
i-


[06-Aug-21 11:10 PM] kingofcats#9205
facts


[06-Aug-21 11:10 PM] kingofcats#9205
how hard is it to keep your hands to yourself i-


[06-Aug-21 11:11 PM] kingofcats#9205
honestly i just remembered how much worse that situation was


[06-Aug-21 11:12 PM] kingofcats#9205
i had proof the guy took inappropriate pictures of the freshman he had been dating and i‚Äôm pretty sure he kept them but ig school didn‚Äôt care but it‚Äôs illegal


[06-Aug-21 11:13 PM] kingofcats#9205
he also contacted me a year later and sent me his contact info for whatever reason which was creepy af


[06-Aug-21 11:13 PM] kingofcats#9205
every school everrrr

{Reactions}
Ew 

[06-Aug-21 11:13 PM] kingofcats#9205
even my middle school did that


[06-Aug-21 11:14 PM] kingofcats#9205
nah that thing with the superintendent apparently didn‚Äôt work even with a parent involved


[06-Aug-21 11:15 PM] kingofcats#9205
i wonder when they're going to have bright idea to actually do something


[06-Aug-21 11:15 PM] kingofcats#9205
like i remember schools saying don't be a bystander and then they are though


[06-Aug-21 11:16 PM] kingofcats#9205
it took an instagram page calling them out and publishing stories from people for the school to even address it and all they did was say that they were doing everything they could :p


[06-Aug-21 11:16 PM] kingofcats#9205
but they were more than happy to take someone off campus in cuffs for drug dealing apparently


[06-Aug-21 11:17 PM] kingofcats#9205
y e s


[06-Aug-21 11:18 PM] kingofcats#9205
and then they do that speech where they say something like "we're going to make the school better"


[06-Aug-21 11:18 PM] kingofcats#9205
but they only meant the buildings


[06-Aug-21 11:19 PM] kingofcats#9205
oml yeahhhhh


[06-Aug-21 11:19 PM] kingofcats#9205
i swear schools are proud of the weirdest things


[06-Aug-21 11:19 PM] kingofcats#9205
for example, why do they have a special trophy for the students with all as at the end of their high school career?


[06-Aug-21 11:21 PM] kingofcats#9205
omg yes and then they're like mEnTaL hEaLtH


[06-Aug-21 11:21 PM] kingofcats#9205
but then they also have those counselors who you can't really be too sure about


[06-Aug-21 11:22 PM] kingofcats#9205
one of my friends had the counselor call cps on their parents even though it wasn't abuse


[06-Aug-21 11:22 PM] kingofcats#9205
like counselor just decided to call cps


[06-Aug-21 11:22 PM] kingofcats#9205
i-


[06-Aug-21 11:23 PM] kingofcats#9205
idk but we got a new one shortly afterwards


[06-Aug-21 11:24 PM] kingofcats#9205
did you all have a favorite teacher at school who wasn't bad like the rest of a mess school was?


[06-Aug-21 11:25 PM] kingofcats#9205
lmao i changed from my high school to a different program halfway through


[06-Aug-21 11:26 PM] kingofcats#9205
yeah i went from high school to high school-community college


[06-Aug-21 11:26 PM] kingofcats#9205
pretty much i went to middle college


[06-Aug-21 11:26 PM] kingofcats#9205
so i have like 90 units already done


[06-Aug-21 11:27 PM] kingofcats#9205
you can see it on the degree audit!


[06-Aug-21 11:27 PM] kingofcats#9205
i keep getting transfer emails but idk if that's because of my 90 units or because it just happens


[06-Aug-21 11:28 PM] kingofcats#9205
right and then you're like what do you wanttttttttt


[06-Aug-21 11:28 PM] kingofcats#9205
i'm dreading foreign language cause i took a placement test for spanish after two years of not studying it


[06-Aug-21 11:28 PM] kingofcats#9205
and i still don't know my results :3


[06-Aug-21 11:29 PM] kingofcats#9205
i didn't take the ap so i'm living in regret


[06-Aug-21 11:29 PM] kingofcats#9205
like i probably should have either taken the ap test or the subject test


[06-Aug-21 11:30 PM] kingofcats#9205
my mom really said that if i didn't do well on my spanish placement i might as well do chinese


[06-Aug-21 11:30 PM] kingofcats#9205
but i kinda forgot how to read & write


[06-Aug-21 11:31 PM] kingofcats#9205
i knowwww, i kept joking about how people would probably be so confused as to why i can speak fine but can't seem to read or write


[06-Aug-21 11:31 PM] kingofcats#9205
oooh alex, do you have any favorite shows?


[06-Aug-21 11:32 PM] kingofcats#9205

[06-Aug-21 11:33 PM] kingofcats#9205
RIGHT?


[06-Aug-21 11:33 PM] kingofcats#9205
did you read the manga?


[06-Aug-21 11:33 PM] kingofcats#9205
the boys didn't just grow up, they glowed up


[06-Aug-21 11:33 PM] kingofcats#9205
honestly it's such an amazing ending


[06-Aug-21 11:33 PM] kingofcats#9205
i was so sad when japan didn't take the chance to use haikyuu to get people interested in the olympics


[06-Aug-21 11:34 PM] kingofcats#9205
ahhhhhhhhhhhh sameeeeeeeeee


[06-Aug-21 11:34 PM] kingofcats#9205

[06-Aug-21 11:34 PM] kingofcats#9205

[06-Aug-21 11:34 PM] kingofcats#9205
but watching it hits different


[06-Aug-21 11:34 PM] kingofcats#9205
do you remember that scene where bokuto tells tsukki that he probably sucks at volleyball?


[06-Aug-21 11:35 PM] kingofcats#9205
i was like but why does that apply to coding too


[06-Aug-21 11:35 PM] kingofcats#9205
i could hear bokuto saying that


[06-Aug-21 11:35 PM] kingofcats#9205
and now i can't unhear it


[06-Aug-21 11:36 PM] kingofcats#9205

[06-Aug-21 11:38 PM] kingofcats#9205
i didn't want anyone new to the series to find out

[06-Aug-21 11:39 PM] kingofcats#9205
i would have spent money on haikyuu merch for olypmic theme


[06-Aug-21 11:40 PM] kingofcats#9205
they really underestimated the amount of money people would be willing to spend


[06-Aug-21 11:40 PM] kingofcats#9205
ye s


[06-Aug-21 11:40 PM] kingofcats#9205
i went to asia, specifically taiwan and i bought stickers for haikyuu from there


[06-Aug-21 11:41 PM] kingofcats#9205
honestly i wish there were more places to buy stuff here


[06-Aug-21 11:41 PM] kingofcats#9205
honestly they shoulddddd


[06-Aug-21 11:42 PM] kingofcats#9205
i want more official merch


[06-Aug-21 11:42 PM] kingofcats#9205
i have to say the people who make the pins are cool but idk i feel like official is different


[06-Aug-21 11:42 PM] kingofcats#9205
i think they do, but as a cosplay jacket


[06-Aug-21 11:42 PM] kingofcats#9205
there's also aoba johsai vbc


[06-Aug-21 11:43 PM] kingofcats#9205

[06-Aug-21 11:43 PM] kingofcats#9205

[06-Aug-21 11:43 PM] kingofcats#9205

[06-Aug-21 11:43 PM] kingofcats#9205
this was years ago though


[06-Aug-21 11:43 PM] kingofcats#9205
i was in 8th grade when i first started watching i think


[06-Aug-21 11:44 PM] kingofcats#9205
i swear 8th grade was when everyone wanted to be edgy lmao


[06-Aug-21 11:44 PM] kingofcats#9205
i remember memorizing the name of bands and stuff


[06-Aug-21 11:45 PM] kingofcats#9205
it was such a weird time


[06-Aug-21 11:45 PM] kingofcats#9205
right


[06-Aug-21 11:45 PM] kingofcats#9205
wasn't that the same time bts got big?


[06-Aug-21 11:45 PM] kingofcats#9205
honestly i remember 8th grade as the time when i think onision was big and so was shane dawson and like that era of youtubers


[06-Aug-21 11:46 PM] kingofcats#9205
i knowww and i knew people who watched them religiously


[06-Aug-21 11:46 PM] kingofcats#9205

[06-Aug-21 11:46 PM] kingofcats#9205
probably my friend group then


[06-Aug-21 11:47 PM] kingofcats#9205
but i remember they were big on twenty one pilots, fall out boy, my chemical romance, pierce the veil, falling in reverse, black veil brides, sleeping with sirens, panic at the disco, bring me the horizon and like other screamo bands


[06-Aug-21 11:48 PM] kingofcats#9205
yeah they were so popular back then


[06-Aug-21 11:48 PM] kingofcats#9205

[06-Aug-21 11:52 PM] kingofcats#9205
my brother likes to spite me and say i'm 5'2.5 he just really had to take that half an inch off me


[06-Aug-21 11:52 PM] kingofcats#9205

[06-Aug-21 11:56 PM] kingofcats#9205
like usually i'm not this talkative


[06-Aug-21 11:56 PM] kingofcats#9205
SAME


[06-Aug-21 11:56 PM] kingofcats#9205
but i also just don't know how to talk to people


[06-Aug-21 11:56 PM] kingofcats#9205
so i get anxious about starting a convo


[06-Aug-21 11:56 PM] kingofcats#9205
and then i do it anyway because idk


[06-Aug-21 11:56 PM] kingofcats#9205
a quiet chat always kinda bugs me


[06-Aug-21 11:56 PM] kingofcats#9205
i blame the guild i joined in a game


[06-Aug-21 11:57 PM] kingofcats#9205
same, i'm probably an ambivert leaning towards introvert


[06-Aug-21 11:57 PM] kingofcats#9205
it's shining nikki!


[06-Aug-21 11:57 PM] kingofcats#9205
it's a newer game from the love nikki series


[06-Aug-21 11:57 PM] kingofcats#9205
i kinda started on a whim


[06-Aug-21 11:57 PM] kingofcats#9205
but the guild has a discord activity requirement so i started chatting and then i couldn't stop


[06-Aug-21 11:58 PM] kingofcats#9205

i personally loved darling in the franxx, but it's also one of those that not everyone likes


[07-Aug-21 12:05 AM] kingofcats#9205
i thought that how to keep a mummy was great


[07-Aug-21 12:05 AM] kingofcats#9205
tanaka-kun is always listless is pretty great


[07-Aug-21 12:05 AM] kingofcats#9205

i read an obscene amount of manga once online school started


[07-Aug-21 12:08 AM] kingofcats#9205
mangadex or bato.to


[07-Aug-21 12:09 AM] kingofcats#9205
some scans teams also made their own sites after mangadex went down for maintenance


[07-Aug-21 12:09 AM] kingofcats#9205
mangadex is adless and bato.to has some i think


[07-Aug-21 12:09 AM] kingofcats#9205
mangadex died for a few months but it's back and running


[07-Aug-21 12:10 AM] kingofcats#9205
lmaooo i was using mangadex to read and track what i was reading so i found out all that stuff


[07-Aug-21 12:10 AM] kingofcats#9205
ahahah


[07-Aug-21 12:10 AM] kingofcats#9205
i had like manhwas, manhuas, and mangas all in there


[07-Aug-21 12:10 AM] kingofcats#9205

[07-Aug-21 12:10 AM] kingofcats#9205

[07-Aug-21 12:10 AM] kingofcats#9205

[07-Aug-21 12:10 AM] kingofcats#9205

[07-Aug-21 12:11 AM] kingofcats#9205

[07-Aug-21 12:12 AM] kingofcats#9205
lmaoooo a lot of what i read is in progress


[07-Aug-21 12:12 AM] kingofcats#9205
but honestly it could be a good thing you don't finish


[07-Aug-21 12:12 AM] kingofcats#9205
sometimes you get so invested that you forget to do everything else


[07-Aug-21 12:12 AM] kingofcats#9205
there were a couple times where i stayed up wayyy too late reading


[07-Aug-21 12:13 AM] kingofcats#9205
but it's also so bad when you're 100 chapters behind or something


[07-Aug-21 12:13 AM] kingofcats#9205
i was around 200 chapters behind, if not more on tower of god


[07-Aug-21 12:13 AM] kingofcats#9205
and i wasted like three days reading it all


[07-Aug-21 12:14 AM] kingofcats#9205
and then i stopped reading months later


[07-Aug-21 12:14 AM] kingofcats#9205
honestly god of high school was the same


[07-Aug-21 12:14 AM] kingofcats#9205
at first i was so hyped


[07-Aug-21 12:14 AM] kingofcats#9205
and then it got too long


[07-Aug-21 12:14 AM] kingofcats#9205
lookism ended up with the same problem


[07-Aug-21 12:14 AM] kingofcats#9205

yeah i started a conversation at like 10pm


[07-Aug-21 12:16 AM] kingofcats#9205
it was a whim kind of decision


[07-Aug-21 12:17 AM] kingofcats#9205
i usually stay up way too late


[07-Aug-21 12:17 AM] kingofcats#9205
i usually recommend bato.to or mangadex


[07-Aug-21 12:17 AM] kingofcats#9205

[07-Aug-21 12:17 AM] kingofcats#9205

[07-Aug-21 12:21 AM] kingofcats#9205
it was the love triangle thing that made me stop


[07-Aug-21 12:21 AM] kingofcats#9205
yesssss


[07-Aug-21 12:21 AM] kingofcats#9205
wait have any of you read men of the harem or remarried empress


[07-Aug-21 12:22 AM] kingofcats#9205
strongest florist is pretty great


[07-Aug-21 12:22 AM] kingofcats#9205
oh it's hard to get into, definitely


[07-Aug-21 12:22 AM] kingofcats#9205

[07-Aug-21 12:27 AM] kingofcats#9205

[07-Aug-21 12:27 AM] kingofcats#9205

[07-Aug-21 12:27 AM] kingofcats#9205
until then


[07-Aug-21 12:28 AM] kingofcats#9205
ahahahah i kept telling myself this week i'd go to bed early so i could wake up and get good sleep before class


[07-Aug-21 12:28 AM] kingofcats#9205
i went to bed at 1 am and woke at 7-8 am


[07-Aug-21 12:28 AM] kingofcats#9205
it wasn't good sleep


[07-Aug-21 12:29 AM] kingofcats#9205
s a m  e


[07-Aug-21 12:29 AM] kingofcats#9205
w h y


[07-Aug-21 12:29 AM] kingofcats#9205
i ask despite having pulled an all-nighter to see what it was like


[07-Aug-21 12:29 AM] kingofcats#9205
i knew a few insomniacs


[07-Aug-21 12:29 AM] kingofcats#9205
so i got curious


[07-Aug-21 12:30 AM] kingofcats#9205
full 24 hours


[07-Aug-21 12:30 AM] kingofcats#9205
no sleep


[07-Aug-21 12:30 AM] kingofcats#9205
yeahhhhh it's not


[07-Aug-21 12:30 AM] kingofcats#9205
i was so out of it it wasn't even funny


[07-Aug-21 12:30 AM] kingofcats#9205
i also knew someone who had a caffeine overdose so now i know the symptoms for that


[07-Aug-21 12:31 AM] kingofcats#9205
it was our mutual classmate's fault


[07-Aug-21 12:31 AM] kingofcats#9205
my friend gave him money to buy some trader joe's cold brew for them and then the guy went and bought two giant bottles of the concentrated type


[07-Aug-21 12:31 AM] kingofcats#9205
which my friend drank despite the fact you're supposed to dilute that


[07-Aug-21 12:31 AM] kingofcats#9205
yeah


[07-Aug-21 12:31 AM] kingofcats#9205
yeah!!! for sure


[07-Aug-21 12:31 AM] kingofcats#9205
i handle caffeine poorly


[07-Aug-21 12:32 AM] kingofcats#9205
that i don't know lmao


[07-Aug-21 12:32 AM] kingofcats#9205
idk how people drink coffee black


[07-Aug-21 12:33 AM] kingofcats#9205
i think the only time i've heard of someone having black coffee that seemed feasible was affogato


[07-Aug-21 12:33 AM] kingofcats#9205
wait elementary/middle school?


[07-Aug-21 12:33 AM] kingofcats#9205
my parents wouldn't let me touch that stuff


[07-Aug-21 12:33 AM] kingofcats#9205
they said it would make me short
but i'm 5'3


[07-Aug-21 12:34 AM] kingofcats#9205
although they say that's also my disordered eating & messed up sleep schedule


[07-Aug-21 12:34 AM] kingofcats#9205
my brother had coffee when he was a child


[07-Aug-21 12:34 AM] kingofcats#9205
and he's taller than me


[07-Aug-21 12:35 AM] kingofcats#9205
i remember going to some chinese school on saturdays


[07-Aug-21 12:35 AM] kingofcats#9205
and every year they'd try to convince us kids to go vegetarian


[07-Aug-21 12:35 AM] kingofcats#9205
cause they were buddhist


[07-Aug-21 12:35 AM] kingofcats#9205
not as far as i know


[07-Aug-21 12:36 AM] kingofcats#9205
they also tried to convert us and make us pray


[07-Aug-21 12:36 AM] kingofcats#9205
never had butter chicken


[07-Aug-21 12:37 AM] kingofcats#9205
i have no clue, it was a taiwanese organization that my parents registered me for


[07-Aug-21 12:37 AM] kingofcats#9205
mood


[07-Aug-21 12:37 AM] kingofcats#9205
either way i stopped after sixth grade


[07-Aug-21 12:37 AM] kingofcats#9205
but i used to cause so much trouble there


[07-Aug-21 12:37 AM] kingofcats#9205
yessssssss


[07-Aug-21 12:37 AM] kingofcats#9205
so now i'm almost illiterate in chinese ahahahahah


[07-Aug-21 12:38 AM] kingofcats#9205
i use google translate so i can read


[07-Aug-21 12:38 AM] kingofcats#9205
i can't understand pinyin sometimes


[07-Aug-21 12:38 AM] kingofcats#9205
but i can understand old people talking cause my relatives talk in chinese all the time


[07-Aug-21 12:39 AM] kingofcats#9205
although i probably understand more taiwanese over chinese


[07-Aug-21 12:39 AM] kingofcats#9205
most of my older relatives speak it


[07-Aug-21 12:40 AM] kingofcats#9205
so i picked it up pretty fast cause i was pretty much the only child among the elderly


[07-Aug-21 12:40 AM] kingofcats#9205
but sometimes they speak at me in taiwanese and i get all confused cause they think i know more than i do


[07-Aug-21 12:40 AM] kingofcats#9205
oml i was so bad when i went to taiwan two or three years ago


[07-Aug-21 12:40 AM] kingofcats#9205
i just spoke english the whole time


[07-Aug-21 12:41 AM] kingofcats#9205
i can speak some taiwanese, enough to converse


[07-Aug-21 12:41 AM] kingofcats#9205
but usually i don't and i'm apparently not supposed to


[07-Aug-21 12:41 AM] kingofcats#9205
mainly cause my cousins on my mom's side don't speak it ig?


[07-Aug-21 12:41 AM] kingofcats#9205
so it's just weird if i'm speaking taiwanese or using taiwanese phrases when they don't


[07-Aug-21 12:41 AM] kingofcats#9205
not that i don't


[07-Aug-21 12:42 AM] kingofcats#9205
i used to mix taiwanese and chinese soooooo much


[07-Aug-21 12:42 AM] kingofcats#9205
that's a joy luck club moment i swear


[07-Aug-21 12:42 AM] kingofcats#9205
my mom always lectures me in chinese but i speak english i-


[07-Aug-21 12:43 AM] kingofcats#9205
right?


[07-Aug-21 12:43 AM] kingofcats#9205
idk what it is


[07-Aug-21 12:43 AM] kingofcats#9205
i am not part of the cult


[07-Aug-21 12:44 AM] kingofcats#9205
my status is just a cat


[07-Aug-21 12:44 AM] kingofcats#9205
cause cats


[07-Aug-21 12:44 AM] kingofcats#9205
ahahahah i did invisible for a bit but couldn't stand it


[07-Aug-21 12:44 AM] kingofcats#9205
i just do dnd cause i'm in a bunch of servers so i get notifs all day


[07-Aug-21 12:44 AM] kingofcats#9205
and i hear the noises


[07-Aug-21 12:44 AM] kingofcats#9205
plus you can sometimes hear the discord notifs in the background of your zoom


[07-Aug-21 12:45 AM] kingofcats#9205
there was this one dude in my class who would talk and there would be just the sound of discord notifs


[07-Aug-21 12:45 AM] kingofcats#9205
ironically the notifs were messages from people telling him to turn on dnd


[07-Aug-21 12:46 AM] kingofcats#9205
i swear no one paid any attention in class


[07-Aug-21 12:46 AM] kingofcats#9205
i did absolutely nothing in most of my classes


[07-Aug-21 12:46 AM] kingofcats#9205
i didn't even read some of my required reading


[07-Aug-21 12:46 AM] kingofcats#9205
my econ/us history was like free period


[07-Aug-21 12:47 AM] kingofcats#9205
i was supposed to read dracula, couldn't  get interested


[07-Aug-21 12:47 AM] kingofcats#9205
and pretty much only used the book for quotes


[07-Aug-21 12:47 AM] kingofcats#9205
my professors & teachers never really called on people


[07-Aug-21 12:48 AM] kingofcats#9205
i didn't have to read any shakespeare besides hamlet


[07-Aug-21 12:48 AM] kingofcats#9205
the rest of my year was short stories


[07-Aug-21 12:49 AM] kingofcats#9205
i honestly made things up for practically every essay i had


[07-Aug-21 12:49 AM] kingofcats#9205
i used to have to write art analysis critiques in my art class at high school so i got used to making things up


[07-Aug-21 12:49 AM] kingofcats#9205
my english 1b professor really thought i had reading comprehension issues


[07-Aug-21 12:49 AM] kingofcats#9205
but i didn't actually read dracula and therefore had no idea what happened in the plot


[07-Aug-21 12:50 AM] kingofcats#9205
but since she explained what happened, i wrote an essay that she thought was perfect


[07-Aug-21 12:50 AM] kingofcats#9205
it was that bad


[07-Aug-21 12:50 AM] kingofcats#9205
so now my brain is just mush


[07-Aug-21 12:51 AM] kingofcats#9205
i honestly don't know how i do it, but i have yet to encounter a teacher who finds my writing abilities bad
math however....


[07-Aug-21 12:51 AM] kingofcats#9205
oml sameeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee


[07-Aug-21 12:51 AM] kingofcats#9205
i feel like i'm just going to be losing my mind when school starts


[07-Aug-21 12:51 AM] kingofcats#9205
i only just got used to socializing again


[07-Aug-21 12:52 AM] kingofcats#9205
earlier in the summer when everyone got their acceptances and were reaching out to make friends i got a handful of dms


[07-Aug-21 12:52 AM] kingofcats#9205
and i really froze up and freaked out


[07-Aug-21 12:52 AM] kingofcats#9205

[07-Aug-21 12:53 AM] kingofcats#9205

my brain would fry itself


[07-Aug-21 12:57 AM] kingofcats#9205
i might take a minor though


[07-Aug-21 12:58 AM] kingofcats#9205
i had a few classmates who completed an aa


[07-Aug-21 12:58 AM] kingofcats#9205
yeah it's one or the other


[07-Aug-21 12:59 AM] kingofcats#9205
i haven't checked course catalog yet, though i should


[07-Aug-21 12:59 AM] kingofcats#9205
its like being a full time community college student and a full time high school student


[07-Aug-21 01:00 AM] kingofcats#9205
might be because it's only offered then


[07-Aug-21 01:00 AM] kingofcats#9205
some classes are like that


[07-Aug-21 01:00 AM] kingofcats#9205
well i think you can swap it out unless i'm wrong


[07-Aug-21 01:00 AM] kingofcats#9205
but those are all considered ge


[07-Aug-21 01:00 AM] kingofcats#9205
it actually wasn't


[07-Aug-21 01:00 AM] kingofcats#9205
i had 2 high school classes and 3 college classes


[07-Aug-21 01:01 AM] kingofcats#9205
i also took like 3 classes at another community college


[07-Aug-21 01:01 AM] kingofcats#9205
my classmates who did aas took classes at the community college we all attended and did more at deanza or something to get their aa


[07-Aug-21 01:01 AM] kingofcats#9205

[07-Aug-21 01:01 AM] kingofcats#9205

[07-Aug-21 01:02 AM] kingofcats#9205

[07-Aug-21 01:02 AM] kingofcats#9205
i got to pick my class times


[07-Aug-21 01:02 AM] kingofcats#9205

[07-Aug-21 01:02 AM] kingofcats#9205

[07-Aug-21 01:02 AM] kingofcats#9205
and i remember being so hyped about real cadavers in human bio


[07-Aug-21 01:03 AM] kingofcats#9205

[07-Aug-21 01:03 AM] kingofcats#9205

[07-Aug-21 01:04 AM] kingofcats#9205
but i watch it even though i jump at everything


[07-Aug-21 01:04 AM] kingofcats#9205
i watched it and i was afraid for a really long time


[07-Aug-21 01:05 AM] kingofcats#9205

[07-Aug-21 01:05 AM] kingofcats#9205

[07-Aug-21 01:05 AM] kingofcats#9205
silent hill is really scary ngl


[07-Aug-21 01:06 AM] kingofcats#9205

[07-Aug-21 01:07 AM] kingofcats#9205
i don't understand how people don't find things scary


[07-Aug-21 01:07 AM] kingofcats#9205
my english teacher was like that


[07-Aug-21 01:07 AM] kingofcats#9205
he would go to haunted houses where you had to sign a waiver for the experience y'know of getting scared by random people who were paid to scare you


[07-Aug-21 01:07 AM] kingofcats#9205
and he was like meh


[07-Aug-21 01:08 AM] kingofcats#9205

[07-Aug-21 01:21 AM] kingofcats#9205

[07-Aug-21 01:21 AM] kingofcats#9205
it's okay we can just spam this place


[07-Aug-21 01:21 AM] kingofcats#9205

[07-Aug-21 01:24 AM] kingofcats#9205
what's the flavor you usually get?


[07-Aug-21 01:24 AM] kingofcats#9205
lmaooooooooooo


[07-Aug-21 01:25 AM] kingofcats#9205
taro's my personal favorite tbh


[07-Aug-21 01:25 AM] kingofcats#9205
i grew up drinking that flavor specifically


[07-Aug-21 01:25 AM] kingofcats#9205
honestly i hope that by the end of five weeks, this chat is actually more active ahahahah


[07-Aug-21 01:25 AM] kingofcats#9205
oh the taro isn't like actual taro usually


[07-Aug-21 01:25 AM] kingofcats#9205
they have this taro powder


[07-Aug-21 01:26 AM] kingofcats#9205
i've had actual taro and it was flavorless


[07-Aug-21 01:26 AM] kingofcats#9205
my mom also once blended taro and put in some boba pearls


[07-Aug-21 01:26 AM] kingofcats#9205
and that was traumatic


[07-Aug-21 01:26 AM] kingofcats#9205
ahahaha i guess i'll have to be the catalyst


[07-Aug-21 01:26 AM] kingofcats#9205
not that i mind


[07-Aug-21 01:27 AM] kingofcats#9205
i usually end up starting a bunch of conversations in a different server i'm in


[07-Aug-21 01:27 AM] kingofcats#9205
Y E S i hope for that


[07-Aug-21 01:27 AM] kingofcats#9205
because i'm also v awkward


[07-Aug-21 01:27 AM] kingofcats#9205
yessssssssss


[07-Aug-21 01:27 AM] kingofcats#9205
i tried for like 2 days ish? maybe?


[07-Aug-21 01:27 AM] kingofcats#9205
idk


[07-Aug-21 01:27 AM] kingofcats#9205
finally figured it out ahahahah


[07-Aug-21 01:28 AM] kingofcats#9205
i had a lot of practice from the other server since it's a guild server for a game where i have an activity req


[07-Aug-21 01:28 AM] kingofcats#9205
i know some of the massive servers have really active chats


[07-Aug-21 01:28 AM] kingofcats#9205
but i can't handle those cause you only meet people for what, five minutes?


[07-Aug-21 01:29 AM] kingofcats#9205
yep!!!!!


[07-Aug-21 01:29 AM] kingofcats#9205
although the kny server i'm in had a hilarious shrine for a once extremely active member of their server


[07-Aug-21 01:29 AM] kingofcats#9205
and the funniest part was that the guy's username was inosuke


[07-Aug-21 01:29 AM] kingofcats#9205
so for a while i thought they worshipped inosuke

[07-Aug-21 01:29 AM] kingofcats#9205
lmaooo he was a character


[07-Aug-21 01:30 AM] kingofcats#9205
i thought they worshipped him


[07-Aug-21 01:30 AM] kingofcats#9205
turns out it wasn't a cult


[07-Aug-21 01:30 AM] kingofcats#9205
honestly most of the way i've been comprehending life since lockdown has been haikyuu


[07-Aug-21 01:31 AM] kingofcats#9205
same! i saw someone with the username iwa and immediately thought of haikyuu


[07-Aug-21 01:31 AM] kingofcats#9205
haikyuu is pretty fun and wholesome


[07-Aug-21 01:32 AM] kingofcats#9205
the fandom is crazyyy big though


[07-Aug-21 01:32 AM] kingofcats#9205
i think i started in 8th grade


[07-Aug-21 01:32 AM] kingofcats#9205
i think if you're new, the anime might be easier to do over the manga


[07-Aug-21 01:32 AM] kingofcats#9205
the manga is finished but there are around 200 chaps


[07-Aug-21 01:32 AM] kingofcats#9205
i mean i love the manga sooooooo


[07-Aug-21 01:32 AM] kingofcats#9205
but yeah


[07-Aug-21 01:33 AM] kingofcats#9205
the anime has four seasons + the side season


[07-Aug-21 01:33 AM] kingofcats#9205
so far


[07-Aug-21 01:33 AM] kingofcats#9205
sameeeeeeee


[07-Aug-21 01:33 AM] kingofcats#9205
that's how i ended up reading manga


[07-Aug-21 01:34 AM] kingofcats#9205
and well i couldn't stop myself from reading wayyy too much


[07-Aug-21 01:34 AM] kingofcats#9205
but there are a bunch of different fandom related jokes that you end up understanding afterwards ig


[07-Aug-21 01:34 AM] kingofcats#9205
so there's that


[07-Aug-21 01:35 AM] kingofcats#9205
ahahahah the only person who probably consistently would make those references might be me ahahah


[07-Aug-21 01:35 AM] kingofcats#9205
yeah it really takes a lot of time and effort


[07-Aug-21 01:35 AM] kingofcats#9205
i think i brought up a couple of older references that had people dying


[07-Aug-21 01:36 AM] kingofcats#9205
it's funny how i can't remember what i did yesterday, but i remember most everything from haikyuu


[07-Aug-21 01:36 AM] kingofcats#9205
yeah!!! like i know a little too much about a bunch of discord bots


[07-Aug-21 01:37 AM] kingofcats#9205
and i also know how to make a webhook


[07-Aug-21 01:37 AM] kingofcats#9205
mainly moderation bots like mee6, tatsu, yagpdb, dyno but also some of the reaction role bots as well


[07-Aug-21 01:38 AM] kingofcats#9205

[07-Aug-21 01:38 AM] kingofcats#9205
mind you the reason why i turned on dev mode was not good reasons


[07-Aug-21 01:38 AM] kingofcats#9205
my friend was really annoyed by some kid and decided to try to get their ip from the discord account


[07-Aug-21 01:39 AM] kingofcats#9205
but since they had a steam linked we actually did find the location :p


[07-Aug-21 01:39 AM] kingofcats#9205
dev mode is useful for a bunch of stuff


[07-Aug-21 01:39 AM] kingofcats#9205
my parents used to use skype to call relatives


[07-Aug-21 01:40 AM] kingofcats#9205
i have a bad habit of googling too well

[07-Aug-21 01:40 AM] kingofcats#9205

[07-Aug-21 01:41 AM] kingofcats#9205

i don't even know what that means


[07-Aug-21 01:42 AM] kingofcats#9205
that is true josh


[07-Aug-21 01:42 AM] kingofcats#9205
but yeah, google makes me sound smart and accomplished cause i'm credited in some paper for cs


[07-Aug-21 01:42 AM] kingofcats#9205
but i actually knew nothing about what we were doing


[07-Aug-21 01:42 AM] kingofcats#9205

i didn't have a middle name until now


[07-Aug-21 01:45 AM] kingofcats#9205

{Reactions}
‚òùÔ∏è 

[07-Aug-21 01:51 AM] kingofcats#9205
guess it worked, i blame my ~~cult~~ i mean new guild


[07-Aug-21 01:51 AM] kingofcats#9205
i keep telling myself i'll run out of things to say, and then i don't because my midnight brain always comes up with something weird


[07-Aug-21 01:52 AM] kingofcats#9205
i actually liked irl social interactions, i could walk away


[07-Aug-21 01:52 AM] kingofcats#9205
i feel trapped in some online convos, esp when they're private cause i've had people private message me and be creepy


[07-Aug-21 01:52 AM] kingofcats#9205
soooo


[07-Aug-21 01:53 AM] kingofcats#9205
nah i like physically walking away, i think it makes the message clearer


[07-Aug-21 01:53 AM] kingofcats#9205
i got messaged by some dude who i didn't know on snap and we were in the same ucsd group chat


[07-Aug-21 01:53 AM] kingofcats#9205
and i got weird vibes


[07-Aug-21 01:53 AM] kingofcats#9205
and then turns out he was also messaging another friend of mine in the same gc


[07-Aug-21 01:54 AM] kingofcats#9205
and he asked to call with her despite us all only meeting for the first time that day


[07-Aug-21 01:54 AM] kingofcats#9205
then when i refused to give him my insta, he really stalked me and found me and shamelessly sent me a follow request


[07-Aug-21 01:54 AM] kingofcats#9205
so i blocked him on both accounts :p


[07-Aug-21 01:54 AM] kingofcats#9205
lmfaooooo


[07-Aug-21 01:54 AM] kingofcats#9205
that makes me think of haikyuu


[07-Aug-21 01:55 AM] kingofcats#9205
i mean his insta was really weird too


[07-Aug-21 01:55 AM] kingofcats#9205
one of my other friends insta stalked him and he had really weird posts about blades and murder?


[07-Aug-21 01:55 AM] kingofcats#9205
i don't remember exactly, but it was creepy


[07-Aug-21 01:55 AM] kingofcats#9205
s a m e


[07-Aug-21 01:56 AM] kingofcats#9205
i will zoom away


[07-Aug-21 01:56 AM] kingofcats#9205
i honestly got really lonely and bored during the whole zoom life


[07-Aug-21 01:56 AM] kingofcats#9205
ahahah i was in track and cross country two years ago


[07-Aug-21 01:56 AM] kingofcats#9205
i assume i can run fast enough to get out of a bad situation


[07-Aug-21 01:56 AM] kingofcats#9205
though i've never tried


[07-Aug-21 01:57 AM] kingofcats#9205
s a me


[07-Aug-21 01:57 AM] kingofcats#9205
oh i can tolerate walking for a long time


[07-Aug-21 01:57 AM] kingofcats#9205
there have been a number of occasions where my family has gotten lost so at this point i'm just like sure whatever


[07-Aug-21 01:57 AM] kingofcats#9205
ahahahahahahah


[07-Aug-21 01:58 AM] kingofcats#9205
honestly though i'm so used to seeing people's pfps that when i see real faces i always end up surprised


[07-Aug-21 01:58 AM] kingofcats#9205
i feel like that's the same for me


[07-Aug-21 01:58 AM] kingofcats#9205
i guess people get all shocked that i don't look like tendou satori


[07-Aug-21 01:59 AM] kingofcats#9205
it's also weird whenever people find my linkedin and the kinda know me and someone messages me with ur pretty


[07-Aug-21 01:59 AM] kingofcats#9205
like pls no


[07-Aug-21 01:59 AM] kingofcats#9205
ahahahahah


[07-Aug-21 01:59 AM] kingofcats#9205
i don't know why i did but i did


[07-Aug-21 01:59 AM] kingofcats#9205
ahahah


[07-Aug-21 02:00 AM] kingofcats#9205
oml trueeee


[07-Aug-21 02:00 AM] kingofcats#9205
i mean some people have really cute pfps


[07-Aug-21 02:00 AM] kingofcats#9205
y e s


[07-Aug-21 02:00 AM] kingofcats#9205
it is


[07-Aug-21 02:00 AM] kingofcats#9205
honestly animal pfps are usually the best


[07-Aug-21 02:01 AM] kingofcats#9205
but i also really have a soft spot for the haikyuu ones as well


[07-Aug-21 02:01 AM] kingofcats#9205
especially the ones from the manga


[07-Aug-21 02:01 AM] kingofcats#9205
ahahahahahah


[07-Aug-21 02:01 AM] kingofcats#9205
i honestly found a bunch of zoom backgrounds


[07-Aug-21 02:02 AM] kingofcats#9205
so i keep swapping them


[07-Aug-21 02:02 AM] kingofcats#9205
i usually try to match with whatever i'm wearing and it's kind of a game now


[07-Aug-21 02:02 AM] kingofcats#9205
i mean i have yet to see farmer ushijima or deadchi


[07-Aug-21 02:02 AM] kingofcats#9205
i keep playing with them


[07-Aug-21 02:03 AM] kingofcats#9205
i also end up stretching a lot ahahha


[07-Aug-21 02:03 AM] kingofcats#9205
my inner cat is like stretchy stretchy time


[07-Aug-21 02:03 AM] kingofcats#9205
my anxiety makes me hyper aware


[07-Aug-21 02:03 AM] kingofcats#9205
especially since once i was unmuted and i told my brother to shut up and my professor was recording


[07-Aug-21 02:03 AM] kingofcats#9205
:p


[07-Aug-21 02:03 AM] kingofcats#9205
sooooooo


[07-Aug-21 02:04 AM] kingofcats#9205
nightmare moment right there


[07-Aug-21 02:04 AM] kingofcats#9205
it's fine though


[07-Aug-21 02:04 AM] kingofcats#9205
the recording is probably gone now


[07-Aug-21 02:04 AM] kingofcats#9205
sameeeeeeeeee


[07-Aug-21 02:04 AM] kingofcats#9205
i get so anxious


[07-Aug-21 02:04 AM] kingofcats#9205
and then i also worry about what people see me doing


[07-Aug-21 02:04 AM] kingofcats#9205
even if i'm just stretching cause sometimes i like to make faces


[07-Aug-21 02:05 AM] kingofcats#9205
lmaoooo that's also a good way


[07-Aug-21 02:05 AM] kingofcats#9205
i'm gonna miss being able to have a plushie on my table


[07-Aug-21 02:06 AM] kingofcats#9205
i don't mind because people kinda stare to start sometimes


[07-Aug-21 02:06 AM] kingofcats#9205
lmaoooo i keep it on my desk


[07-Aug-21 02:06 AM] kingofcats#9205
it's a husky and i want to say it's as old as i am if not a bit older


[07-Aug-21 02:07 AM] kingofcats#9205
lmaooooo


[07-Aug-21 02:07 AM] kingofcats#9205
it's gonna stay home


[07-Aug-21 02:07 AM] kingofcats#9205
although i swear i can't sleep without holding something like a plushie


[07-Aug-21 02:07 AM] kingofcats#9205
so i will be bringing a bigger husky plushie for sure


[07-Aug-21 02:07 AM] kingofcats#9205
i'm more concerned about the people who sleep like a log


[07-Aug-21 02:08 AM] kingofcats#9205
pffft


[07-Aug-21 02:08 AM] kingofcats#9205
the husky that's probably as old as i am makes a barking sound


[07-Aug-21 02:08 AM] kingofcats#9205
it's one of those old kids toys


[07-Aug-21 02:08 AM] kingofcats#9205
it's a desk ornament, not a plushie really


[07-Aug-21 02:08 AM] kingofcats#9205
probably


[07-Aug-21 02:08 AM] kingofcats#9205
idk


[07-Aug-21 02:09 AM] kingofcats#9205
like i don't hug it or anything


[07-Aug-21 02:09 AM] kingofcats#9205
ahahahahahah


[07-Aug-21 02:10 AM] kingofcats#9205
honestly i find it so funny how i want to hug people when it's a pandemic


[07-Aug-21 02:10 AM] kingofcats#9205
but when it's not then i'm like what is happening when someone randomly hugs me


[07-Aug-21 02:11 AM] kingofcats#9205
honestly i don't mind being hugged but that's mainly because i had a few friends who just randomly hugged me


[07-Aug-21 02:11 AM] kingofcats#9205
so i'm kind of in a state of okay you want to hug me fine


[07-Aug-21 02:11 AM] kingofcats#9205
you want to squish my cheeks, fine


[07-Aug-21 02:11 AM] kingofcats#9205
kind of thing


[07-Aug-21 02:12 AM] kingofcats#9205
i think the only thing i'm usually like oh no is like being picked up physically


[07-Aug-21 02:12 AM] kingofcats#9205
i've had people try to pick me up and it's weird as heckkkkkkkk


[07-Aug-21 02:12 AM] kingofcats#9205
i know


[07-Aug-21 02:13 AM] kingofcats#9205
i also happen to have a number of tall friends


[07-Aug-21 02:13 AM] kingofcats#9205
it's probably cause they're tall


[07-Aug-21 02:13 AM] kingofcats#9205
tall friends tend to have a thing for being like, let me help you experience what it's like to be way too far off the ground


[07-Aug-21 02:13 AM] kingofcats#9205
i mean i look not too short with my friends


[07-Aug-21 02:13 AM] kingofcats#9205
but some of them are like 6ft?


[07-Aug-21 02:14 AM] kingofcats#9205
it's honestly really funny but a lot of the people i know just tower over me


[07-Aug-21 02:15 AM] kingofcats#9205
honestly i swear it's because i'm short


[07-Aug-21 02:15 AM] kingofcats#9205
and that's why i always end up wondering how tall people are


[07-Aug-21 02:15 AM] kingofcats#9205
because i need to know if they have that potential thought process of "aerin is short and small, i want to lift"

[07-Aug-21 02:16 AM] kingofcats#9205
i keep track of people's heights mainly cause i need to know where i measure up to


[07-Aug-21 02:16 AM] kingofcats#9205
that way i know who i can hide behind and for what situations


[07-Aug-21 02:16 AM] kingofcats#9205
oh actually


[07-Aug-21 02:16 AM] kingofcats#9205
random human bio fact i learned a while back


[07-Aug-21 02:16 AM] kingofcats#9205
you shrink over the course of a day


[07-Aug-21 02:17 AM] kingofcats#9205
ahahahah


[07-Aug-21 02:17 AM] kingofcats#9205
supposedly i shrank a whole 0.5 inches


[07-Aug-21 02:17 AM] kingofcats#9205
buuuut when i measured at home, i was exactly 5'3


[07-Aug-21 02:18 AM] kingofcats#9205
soooooo idk what they were talking about


[07-Aug-21 02:18 AM] kingofcats#9205
but i swear that's also short people problems


[07-Aug-21 02:18 AM] kingofcats#9205
riiiiight


[07-Aug-21 02:18 AM] kingofcats#9205
and they're like tall


[07-Aug-21 02:18 AM] kingofcats#9205
honestly i consider 5'8 or taller tall


[07-Aug-21 02:18 AM] kingofcats#9205
cause that's a whole five inches over my head


[07-Aug-21 02:18 AM] kingofcats#9205
ahahahah


[07-Aug-21 02:19 AM] kingofcats#9205
idk


[07-Aug-21 02:19 AM] kingofcats#9205
ask another dude maybe they'd know


[07-Aug-21 02:19 AM] kingofcats#9205
i only know that women is either 5'4 or 5'3


[07-Aug-21 02:19 AM] kingofcats#9205
honestly no clue


[07-Aug-21 02:20 AM] kingofcats#9205
tbh i don't mind being short, it's just kinda like argH when people bring it up


[07-Aug-21 02:20 AM] kingofcats#9205
okay but either way i still think 5'8 is tall


[07-Aug-21 02:20 AM] kingofcats#9205
it's five inches over my head


[07-Aug-21 02:20 AM] kingofcats#9205
i-


[07-Aug-21 02:20 AM] kingofcats#9205
i can sorta


[07-Aug-21 02:20 AM] kingofcats#9205
i swear, tall people don't feel that tall until you stand next to them


[07-Aug-21 02:21 AM] kingofcats#9205
so ethan, you're a whole half a foot taller than i am


[07-Aug-21 02:21 AM] kingofcats#9205
congrats


[07-Aug-21 02:21 AM] kingofcats#9205
like i had a classmate in middle school who was 6'4 and i stood next to him


[07-Aug-21 02:21 AM] kingofcats#9205
and it was interesting how short i felt


[07-Aug-21 02:21 AM] kingofcats#9205
yeah i was in 6th and he was in 7th


[07-Aug-21 02:21 AM] kingofcats#9205
i think he went to lynbrook for a bit?


[07-Aug-21 02:22 AM] kingofcats#9205
ahahaha


[07-Aug-21 02:22 AM] kingofcats#9205
i always forget how tall people are but people at 6ft don't feel too tall to me


[07-Aug-21 02:22 AM] kingofcats#9205
are you sure, i thought he went there


[07-Aug-21 02:22 AM] kingofcats#9205
he would have been  a year above you


[07-Aug-21 02:23 AM] kingofcats#9205
my parents said that if i was a boy they would have called me ethan lmfao


[07-Aug-21 02:23 AM] kingofcats#9205
ahahahah


[07-Aug-21 02:24 AM] kingofcats#9205
i suddenly remembered something really stupid


[07-Aug-21 02:24 AM] kingofcats#9205
i had a classmate who i shared the same set of initials with so the teacher asked who had a middle name and he did so he had to put the initial for his middle name as well


[07-Aug-21 02:24 AM] kingofcats#9205
and it was frederick or something


[07-Aug-21 02:24 AM] kingofcats#9205
but he kept insisting to me that his middle name was pencil sharpener


[07-Aug-21 02:24 AM] kingofcats#9205
this was in second grade, mind you


[07-Aug-21 02:25 AM] kingofcats#9205
no


[07-Aug-21 02:25 AM] kingofcats#9205
i thought it was hilarious


[07-Aug-21 02:25 AM] kingofcats#9205
he also got held back a year


[07-Aug-21 02:25 AM] kingofcats#9205
like in kindergarten or something


[07-Aug-21 02:27 AM] kingofcats#9205
ahahah


[07-Aug-21 02:27 AM] kingofcats#9205
trueeee


[07-Aug-21 02:27 AM] kingofcats#9205
that is an important question


[07-Aug-21 02:27 AM] kingofcats#9205
oop


[07-Aug-21 02:28 AM] kingofcats#9205
honestly it's weird having a middle name now


[07-Aug-21 02:28 AM] kingofcats#9205
i feel like most people have had one for most of their lives


[07-Aug-21 02:28 AM] kingofcats#9205
i actually picked my brother's middle name apparently


[07-Aug-21 02:28 AM] kingofcats#9205
my parents really just gave me a list and said pick


[07-Aug-21 02:29 AM] kingofcats#9205
oh i had an official amendment


[07-Aug-21 02:29 AM] kingofcats#9205
i mean all the names started with 'c'


[07-Aug-21 02:29 AM] kingofcats#9205
did they ever tell you your actual middle name


[07-Aug-21 02:30 AM] kingofcats#9205
guess they do?


[07-Aug-21 02:30 AM] kingofcats#9205
idk i've only heard one instance


[07-Aug-21 02:30 AM] kingofcats#9205
i guess they could if they really wanted to


[07-Aug-21 02:31 AM] kingofcats#9205
honestly i already have a hard time thinking up names for pets, much less children


[07-Aug-21 02:32 AM] kingofcats#9205
scratch that


[07-Aug-21 02:32 AM] kingofcats#9205
i can't even name variables, much less pets or children


[07-Aug-21 02:32 AM] kingofcats#9205
ahahahah


[07-Aug-21 02:32 AM] kingofcats#9205
if anything i'm probably going to steal names from tolkein or dvergatal


[07-Aug-21 02:33 AM] kingofcats#9205
well you might have to name variables and stuff


[07-Aug-21 02:33 AM] kingofcats#9205
i also end up having to name essays


[07-Aug-21 02:33 AM] kingofcats#9205
and poems


[07-Aug-21 02:33 AM] kingofcats#9205
and whatever else my brain comes up with


[07-Aug-21 02:33 AM] kingofcats#9205
and then it turns into what in the actual world does any of this mean


[07-Aug-21 02:34 AM] kingofcats#9205
so when people ask i smile and laugh


[07-Aug-21 02:34 AM] kingofcats#9205
i just follow a format


[07-Aug-21 02:34 AM] kingofcats#9205
i put random synonyms together


[07-Aug-21 02:34 AM] kingofcats#9205
and then i say here you go


[07-Aug-21 02:34 AM] kingofcats#9205
but for poems and stuff i just use whatever really random, abstract thing comes up in my brain first


[07-Aug-21 02:35 AM] kingofcats#9205
ahahahah


[07-Aug-21 02:35 AM] kingofcats#9205
i mean people tend to find deeper meanings in poems


[07-Aug-21 02:35 AM] kingofcats#9205
so i assume they'd do the same with titles


[07-Aug-21 02:35 AM] kingofcats#9205
it's one of those tricks


[07-Aug-21 02:35 AM] kingofcats#9205
kinda like how people find random deeper meaning in art sometimes


[07-Aug-21 02:36 AM] kingofcats#9205
and i just happen to remember the names of random artists and some of their works


[07-Aug-21 02:36 AM] kingofcats#9205
i learned some art history as a child


[07-Aug-21 02:36 AM] kingofcats#9205
so i know a decent bit about older art


[07-Aug-21 02:36 AM] kingofcats#9205
it's honestly just part of the random stuff i happen to know


[07-Aug-21 02:37 AM] kingofcats#9205
lmaooo i learned it when i was really young


[07-Aug-21 02:37 AM] kingofcats#9205
it was kinda drilled into my brain


[07-Aug-21 02:37 AM] kingofcats#9205
just like how to play black jack


[07-Aug-21 02:37 AM] kingofcats#9205
and playing hidden object games


[07-Aug-21 02:38 AM] kingofcats#9205
lmaooo


[07-Aug-21 02:38 AM] kingofcats#9205
i don't know why i remember how to play blackjack so clearly


[07-Aug-21 02:38 AM] kingofcats#9205
honestly same


[07-Aug-21 02:38 AM] kingofcats#9205
i have memory loss


[07-Aug-21 02:38 AM] kingofcats#9205
and sometimes when i google memory loss and i look at the specific kind  i might have


[07-Aug-21 02:38 AM] kingofcats#9205
i end up asking myself if google might be accurate when it gives me dementia


[07-Aug-21 02:39 AM] kingofcats#9205
ahahah


[07-Aug-21 02:39 AM] kingofcats#9205
i've had people tell me i asked them the same question five or six times


[07-Aug-21 02:39 AM] kingofcats#9205
and every single time i say "wait really?"


[07-Aug-21 02:39 AM] kingofcats#9205
i also remember almost nothing about my childhood or even like more recent stuff


[07-Aug-21 02:40 AM] kingofcats#9205
everything goes in my brain and leaves again


[07-Aug-21 02:40 AM] kingofcats#9205
my worst anxiety is that i've said something bad and people remember


[07-Aug-21 02:40 AM] kingofcats#9205
and then they'll ask me what i meant


[07-Aug-21 02:40 AM] kingofcats#9205
and i won't know because no memories


[07-Aug-21 02:41 AM] kingofcats#9205
ahahah worst part is that when i do briefly remember things


[07-Aug-21 02:41 AM] kingofcats#9205
i always end up realizing that the people i knew growing up were crappy people when i knew them


[07-Aug-21 02:41 AM] kingofcats#9205
so then i feel like whatever cause you were horrid too


[07-Aug-21 02:42 AM] kingofcats#9205
and it's so ridiculous


[07-Aug-21 02:42 AM] kingofcats#9205
that too


[07-Aug-21 02:42 AM] kingofcats#9205
but usually i end up remembering why i don't talk to some people and stuff


[07-Aug-21 02:42 AM] kingofcats#9205
but i've been meeting less and less crappy people now


[07-Aug-21 02:42 AM] kingofcats#9205
so that's gotta be a good thing :3


[07-Aug-21 02:43 AM] kingofcats#9205
the fact that there are only four of us online ahahah


[07-Aug-21 02:43 AM] kingofcats#9205
i forget them


[07-Aug-21 02:43 AM] kingofcats#9205
often and then accidentally offend them


[07-Aug-21 02:43 AM] kingofcats#9205
ahahah


[07-Aug-21 02:43 AM] kingofcats#9205
is what i ask myself


[07-Aug-21 02:43 AM] kingofcats#9205
i just like being wide awake at night


[07-Aug-21 02:43 AM] kingofcats#9205
but i also have to wake up tomorrow to go outside and walk ;w;


[07-Aug-21 02:44 AM] kingofcats#9205
i honestly need night owls in revelle because i might just not sleep and want to chat all night


[07-Aug-21 02:44 AM] kingofcats#9205
ahahahah


[07-Aug-21 02:45 AM] kingofcats#9205
i'm excited to hopefully get to stay up late more often at ucsd ahahah


[07-Aug-21 02:45 AM] kingofcats#9205
righttttt you're on the other side of campus


[07-Aug-21 02:45 AM] kingofcats#9205
ahkfalskhfdaf


[07-Aug-21 02:45 AM] kingofcats#9205
my closest night owl friend is at muir i-


[07-Aug-21 02:45 AM] kingofcats#9205
oh i have to fix it but no morning classes for me


[07-Aug-21 02:46 AM] kingofcats#9205
it's always cold in the morning, esp in winter


[07-Aug-21 02:46 AM] kingofcats#9205
sucksssss


[07-Aug-21 02:46 AM] kingofcats#9205
isn't erc past muir


[07-Aug-21 02:46 AM] kingofcats#9205
revelle was my second choice i think


[07-Aug-21 02:46 AM] kingofcats#9205
idk


[07-Aug-21 02:47 AM] kingofcats#9205
my mom was like gl getting to classes


[07-Aug-21 02:47 AM] kingofcats#9205
but i don't care cause there's the aquarium further down


[07-Aug-21 02:47 AM] kingofcats#9205
i just want to go to the aquarium sooooooo


[07-Aug-21 02:47 AM] kingofcats#9205
:p


[07-Aug-21 02:47 AM] kingofcats#9205
that sounds fun


[07-Aug-21 02:47 AM] kingofcats#9205
my uncle was an alum from a long time ago and he told me i could get around just fine with a shuttle


[07-Aug-21 02:48 AM] kingofcats#9205
i just wanna run down to the aquarium


[07-Aug-21 02:48 AM] kingofcats#9205
that's literally it


[07-Aug-21 02:48 AM] kingofcats#9205
everything else is not that interesting ahahah


[07-Aug-21 02:48 AM] kingofcats#9205
that is so niceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee


[07-Aug-21 02:48 AM] kingofcats#9205
yeah i need to find people to stay up with either at my college


[07-Aug-21 02:49 AM] kingofcats#9205
or just stay up with together online


[07-Aug-21 02:49 AM] kingofcats#9205
i have no clue where cogsci is at all


[07-Aug-21 02:49 AM] kingofcats#9205
i hope it's not in the warren area


[07-Aug-21 02:49 AM] kingofcats#9205
ohhhhhhhhhh that is going to be funnnnnnnn


[07-Aug-21 02:50 AM] kingofcats#9205
i can get my exercise in ig :p


[07-Aug-21 02:50 AM] kingofcats#9205
i wish i actually found geisel interesting enough to remember the architect's name smh


[07-Aug-21 02:50 AM] kingofcats#9205
some of the housing at ucla is done by john lautner


[07-Aug-21 02:51 AM] kingofcats#9205
i only remember around 10 names for architects at most


[07-Aug-21 02:51 AM] kingofcats#9205
and most of them had random buildings that i just found pretty


[07-Aug-21 02:51 AM] kingofcats#9205
i probably know more renaissancce artists off the top of my head though


[07-Aug-21 02:51 AM] kingofcats#9205
my mom taught me art history and used to drill me


[07-Aug-21 02:51 AM] kingofcats#9205
we had this book with a card game


[07-Aug-21 02:52 AM] kingofcats#9205
and i must have memorize the names before i knew it


[07-Aug-21 02:52 AM] kingofcats#9205
i think that's why i got into reading mirror text too and font names


[07-Aug-21 02:52 AM] kingofcats#9205
my mom likes art


[07-Aug-21 02:52 AM] kingofcats#9205
idk


[07-Aug-21 02:52 AM] kingofcats#9205
i just know


[07-Aug-21 02:53 AM] kingofcats#9205
i know a number of fonts by name


[07-Aug-21 02:53 AM] kingofcats#9205
it keeps me busy when i'm bored


[07-Aug-21 02:53 AM] kingofcats#9205
i play a guessing game and try to determine whether someone's using google or microsoft based on font


[07-Aug-21 02:53 AM] kingofcats#9205
i also know some of the apple fonts


[07-Aug-21 02:54 AM] kingofcats#9205
it's honestly very useless information


[07-Aug-21 02:54 AM] kingofcats#9205
but presentations are so boring sometimes


[07-Aug-21 02:54 AM] kingofcats#9205
lmaoooooo


[07-Aug-21 02:55 AM] kingofcats#9205
ohhhhhhh those are pretty cool


[07-Aug-21 02:55 AM] kingofcats#9205
i usually just use some kind of sans serif or serif font


[07-Aug-21 02:56 AM] kingofcats#9205
i don't like times new roman cause it's times new roman and prefer palatino


[07-Aug-21 02:56 AM] kingofcats#9205
i honestly just keep one original copy of the formatting and fill everything else in


[07-Aug-21 02:56 AM] kingofcats#9205
i honestly find essays and english the easiest of all classes


[07-Aug-21 02:57 AM] kingofcats#9205
i used to love timed essays


[07-Aug-21 02:57 AM] kingofcats#9205
and i think my teacher hated me for loving timed essays


[07-Aug-21 02:57 AM] kingofcats#9205
well he didn't actually hate me


[07-Aug-21 02:57 AM] kingofcats#9205
i was one of his favorite students


[07-Aug-21 02:57 AM] kingofcats#9205
but i would write a ton of pages of stuff


[07-Aug-21 02:57 AM] kingofcats#9205
it was usually pretty thick when i was finally done


[07-Aug-21 02:58 AM] kingofcats#9205
yeahh


[07-Aug-21 02:58 AM] kingofcats#9205
imagine how the person grading my whap test felt


[07-Aug-21 02:58 AM] kingofcats#9205
they probably felt like they got slapped with a giant tidal wave of words


[07-Aug-21 02:59 AM] kingofcats#9205
i'm just really quick to make thing sup


[07-Aug-21 02:59 AM] kingofcats#9205
oml that act essay is so easy


[07-Aug-21 02:59 AM] kingofcats#9205
so was the sat essay


[07-Aug-21 02:59 AM] kingofcats#9205
except that one time where i got a low score for arguing against the prompt


[07-Aug-21 02:59 AM] kingofcats#9205
but we don't talk about that


[07-Aug-21 02:59 AM] kingofcats#9205
i thought the essay was the easiest part of the standardized test


[07-Aug-21 02:59 AM] kingofcats#9205
i was so bad with math


[07-Aug-21 03:00 AM] kingofcats#9205
i really got a 27 on math


[07-Aug-21 03:00 AM] kingofcats#9205
even though i did calc ab


[07-Aug-21 03:00 AM] kingofcats#9205
honestly that is so fair


[07-Aug-21 03:01 AM] kingofcats#9205
ngl i did terrible in precalc/trig as in i understood almost nothing


[07-Aug-21 03:01 AM] kingofcats#9205
and i still did just fine in calculus ab


[07-Aug-21 03:01 AM] kingofcats#9205
i left with an a


[07-Aug-21 03:01 AM] kingofcats#9205
then a semester later i had to drop calc bc because it was like gibberish to me


[07-Aug-21 03:01 AM] kingofcats#9205
ahahahah


[07-Aug-21 03:02 AM] kingofcats#9205
i was lucky my professor took out the part of the final on integrals since everyone bombed that part


[07-Aug-21 03:02 AM] kingofcats#9205
ahahah


[07-Aug-21 03:02 AM] kingofcats#9205
i only like derivatives


[07-Aug-21 03:02 AM] kingofcats#9205
and my stats class was wayyyyyy better


[07-Aug-21 03:03 AM] kingofcats#9205
i just got to use my calculator and not show most of my work


[07-Aug-21 03:03 AM] kingofcats#9205
i literally took ab and bc back to back in semesters and still forgot integrals


[07-Aug-21 03:03 AM] kingofcats#9205
so now i have to retake bc cause i dropped it


[07-Aug-21 03:04 AM] kingofcats#9205
lmao i have most of my ges done so i can't put it off much longer to begin with lmaoooo


[07-Aug-21 03:05 AM] kingofcats#9205
oh that is going to be fun in the most painful way possible


[07-Aug-21 03:05 AM] kingofcats#9205
that is actually kinda nice


[07-Aug-21 03:06 AM] kingofcats#9205
b is not a jump


[07-Aug-21 03:06 AM] kingofcats#9205
it's a shove


[07-Aug-21 03:06 AM] kingofcats#9205
off a cliff


[07-Aug-21 03:07 AM] kingofcats#9205
it's fine though, i think my current existing college gpa can carry me even if i mess up two math classes


[07-Aug-21 03:07 AM] kingofcats#9205
whenever i see p/np i think of that millenium problem


[07-Aug-21 03:09 AM] kingofcats#9205
it's one of those very difficult to solve math problems that has like a huge reward if you can get the correct solution


[07-Aug-21 03:09 AM] kingofcats#9205
i want to say that one of them did get solved but i also might have remembered wrong


[07-Aug-21 03:09 AM] kingofcats#9205
i know they mentioned p/np but not the actual problem itself


[07-Aug-21 03:10 AM] kingofcats#9205
i was watching gifted and the millenium problems came up


[07-Aug-21 03:10 AM] kingofcats#9205
along with the trachtenberg method i think


[07-Aug-21 03:10 AM] kingofcats#9205
i remember uselessly large words and then when i need to use them my brain goes b l a n k


[07-Aug-21 03:10 AM] kingofcats#9205
trachtenberg is a last name


[07-Aug-21 03:11 AM] kingofcats#9205
i am usually that one student who is technically done but keeps writing anyway


[07-Aug-21 03:12 AM] kingofcats#9205
i know i have a large vocabulary


[07-Aug-21 03:12 AM] kingofcats#9205
i just never use it


[07-Aug-21 03:12 AM] kingofcats#9205
and i really like learning those random words from tumblr that are so rarely used


[07-Aug-21 03:12 AM] kingofcats#9205
and then i don't use them


[07-Aug-21 03:13 AM] kingofcats#9205
the only time those tumblr words ever come into use is when yet another person titles a fanfic using one of those


[07-Aug-21 03:13 AM] kingofcats#9205
i learned words like gracile


[07-Aug-21 03:13 AM] kingofcats#9205
which i never use


[07-Aug-21 03:14 AM] kingofcats#9205
and then i randomly apply chemistry terminology to real life


[07-Aug-21 03:14 AM] kingofcats#9205
despite sleeping through my chemistry honors class during my second semester


[07-Aug-21 03:14 AM] kingofcats#9205
i still don't know how i got an a in that class


[07-Aug-21 03:14 AM] kingofcats#9205
and my chem 1a was carried by huge extra credit


[07-Aug-21 03:14 AM] kingofcats#9205
i overuse state function


[07-Aug-21 03:14 AM] kingofcats#9205
not in the literal sense


[07-Aug-21 03:15 AM] kingofcats#9205
but i just use it to mean like the process isn't important, just the destination


[07-Aug-21 03:15 AM] kingofcats#9205
i think i've also equated people to the different elemental groups before


[07-Aug-21 03:15 AM] kingofcats#9205
and people always look at me funny for it


[07-Aug-21 03:15 AM] kingofcats#9205
not that i find it important how they feel lmfao


[07-Aug-21 03:16 AM] kingofcats#9205
i'll just be like "noble gas personality type" out of the blue


[07-Aug-21 03:16 AM] kingofcats#9205
or i'll say someone's like a halogen


[07-Aug-21 03:16 AM] kingofcats#9205
i think the weirdest thing i've ever done was try to convert all my writing into old english runes


[07-Aug-21 03:17 AM] kingofcats#9205
old english and old english runes are different


[07-Aug-21 03:17 AM] kingofcats#9205
the runes looked a lot like dwarvish from lotr


[07-Aug-21 03:17 AM] kingofcats#9205
and i thought they were pretty


[07-Aug-21 03:17 AM] kingofcats#9205
yeah


[07-Aug-21 03:18 AM] kingofcats#9205
i mean before that i wanted to write mirror script but being left handed, i technically could have done that to start


[07-Aug-21 03:18 AM] kingofcats#9205
yeah it really does


[07-Aug-21 03:18 AM] kingofcats#9205
there's also elvish which is pretty


[07-Aug-21 03:18 AM] kingofcats#9205
i also at one point wanted to be ambidextrous


[07-Aug-21 03:18 AM] kingofcats#9205
so i can kinda write with my right hand


[07-Aug-21 03:18 AM] kingofcats#9205
i mean i usually don't but i can do it alright


[07-Aug-21 03:19 AM] kingofcats#9205
i can read mirrored text just fine


[07-Aug-21 03:19 AM] kingofcats#9205
i can technically draw with my right hand using a mouse


[07-Aug-21 03:19 AM] kingofcats#9205
but not with a pencil


[07-Aug-21 03:19 AM] kingofcats#9205
not that well


[07-Aug-21 03:19 AM] kingofcats#9205
ahahah when i write fast i end up with print-cursive


[07-Aug-21 03:20 AM] kingofcats#9205
the only thing i can consistently draw are cats


[07-Aug-21 03:20 AM] kingofcats#9205
and sometimes bears


[07-Aug-21 03:20 AM] kingofcats#9205
i learned cursive and now i mix my print and cursive


[07-Aug-21 03:20 AM] kingofcats#9205
it looks confusing as heck though reading my notes


[07-Aug-21 03:21 AM] kingofcats#9205
usually when i write words that end in ing, the i disappears


[07-Aug-21 03:21 AM] kingofcats#9205
it just leaves


[07-Aug-21 03:21 AM] kingofcats#9205
i also don't dot my i's anymore sooooooooo


[07-Aug-21 03:21 AM] kingofcats#9205
my i's and e's look similar


[07-Aug-21 03:22 AM] kingofcats#9205
ahahahah i write things down by hand


[07-Aug-21 03:22 AM] kingofcats#9205
i tend to forget otherwise


[07-Aug-21 03:22 AM] kingofcats#9205
cause if i type i sometimes i forget to check where i left whatever i wrote down


[07-Aug-21 03:22 AM] kingofcats#9205
honestly i just realized


[07-Aug-21 03:22 AM] kingofcats#9205
i'm kinda like a function


[07-Aug-21 03:22 AM] kingofcats#9205
i just take in input, create an output


[07-Aug-21 03:23 AM] kingofcats#9205
and then i forget everything again


[07-Aug-21 03:23 AM] kingofcats#9205
it actually explains why i have no clue what i've turned in for the most part


[07-Aug-21 03:23 AM] kingofcats#9205
especially my essays, thank goodness no one asks me to explain those


[07-Aug-21 03:23 AM] kingofcats#9205
ahahah i made my brother so frustrated


[07-Aug-21 03:23 AM] kingofcats#9205
he was trying to help me check my code


[07-Aug-21 03:24 AM] kingofcats#9205
and then he was like wth


[07-Aug-21 03:24 AM] kingofcats#9205
oh i don't even really remember the prompt after i write it


[07-Aug-21 03:24 AM] kingofcats#9205
ahahah


[07-Aug-21 03:24 AM] kingofcats#9205
i literally just try to think of the easiest way to solve the problem so i can write almost zero code


[07-Aug-21 03:24 AM] kingofcats#9205
i mean i just make something up


[07-Aug-21 03:25 AM] kingofcats#9205
if i get a hint of what i should say, i can usually make something up


[07-Aug-21 03:25 AM] kingofcats#9205
guess the theatre classes i took panned out years ago


[07-Aug-21 03:25 AM] kingofcats#9205
ahhhhhh same


[07-Aug-21 03:26 AM] kingofcats#9205
i usually say something and then i end up overexplaining myself


[07-Aug-21 03:26 AM] kingofcats#9205
they give me so much anxiety


[07-Aug-21 03:26 AM] kingofcats#9205
but i also did them ig


[07-Aug-21 03:26 AM] kingofcats#9205
technically i guess i can act, i'm good with expressions


[07-Aug-21 03:26 AM] kingofcats#9205
ahahah


[07-Aug-21 03:26 AM] kingofcats#9205
when we had to do closing circle i really wrote out what i was going to say


[07-Aug-21 03:27 AM] kingofcats#9205
i still panicked anyway ahahah


[07-Aug-21 03:27 AM] kingofcats#9205
i used to do musicals so theoretically i should be okay with like idk stages?


[07-Aug-21 03:27 AM] kingofcats#9205
but i'm not


[07-Aug-21 03:27 AM] kingofcats#9205
it took a long time


[07-Aug-21 03:27 AM] kingofcats#9205
and everyone just kinda thanked other people


[07-Aug-21 03:28 AM] kingofcats#9205
and i just read whatever i wrote while panicking


[07-Aug-21 03:28 AM] kingofcats#9205
oh i have stage fright too


[07-Aug-21 03:28 AM] kingofcats#9205
the deer in the headlights


[07-Aug-21 03:28 AM] kingofcats#9205
oh it was mandatory for everyone


[07-Aug-21 03:29 AM] kingofcats#9205
i swear things were easier when we were kids


[07-Aug-21 03:29 AM] kingofcats#9205
like being on stage and stuff


[07-Aug-21 03:29 AM] kingofcats#9205
i don't know how i did it then


[07-Aug-21 03:29 AM] kingofcats#9205
it really wassss


[07-Aug-21 03:29 AM] kingofcats#9205
honestly i was thinking back to the musicals i did


[07-Aug-21 03:29 AM] kingofcats#9205
and i just realized how weirdly sexist my fair lady was


[07-Aug-21 03:30 AM] kingofcats#9205
like there's this whole song when the english professor rants about women


[07-Aug-21 03:30 AM] kingofcats#9205
trueeeee


[07-Aug-21 03:31 AM] kingofcats#9205
honestly i got into musicals because of my parents


[07-Aug-21 03:31 AM] kingofcats#9205
awwwwwwwwwwwwwwww


[07-Aug-21 03:31 AM] kingofcats#9205
i think the first musical i saw was les mis or phantom


[07-Aug-21 03:31 AM] kingofcats#9205
i didn't understand the lovely ladies thing until like years later


[07-Aug-21 03:31 AM] kingofcats#9205
no not really


[07-Aug-21 03:32 AM] kingofcats#9205
my dad just had them and i was introduced to them early


[07-Aug-21 03:32 AM] kingofcats#9205
although i watched ghibli films long before that


[07-Aug-21 03:32 AM] kingofcats#9205
i think the last muscial i saw was carrie


[07-Aug-21 03:33 AM] kingofcats#9205
ohhh hamilton is fun


[07-Aug-21 03:33 AM] kingofcats#9205
i don't remember if i did


[07-Aug-21 03:33 AM] kingofcats#9205
but i was looking forward to the in the heights film


[07-Aug-21 03:34 AM] kingofcats#9205
did you ever have a gymnastics phase?


[07-Aug-21 03:34 AM] kingofcats#9205
now that i think of it, maybe my first musical was sound of music


[07-Aug-21 03:34 AM] kingofcats#9205
ahahah sameeeeeeeeeee


[07-Aug-21 03:34 AM] kingofcats#9205
and then i stopped


[07-Aug-21 03:35 AM] kingofcats#9205
but i really wanted to do a handstand, so i taught myself


[07-Aug-21 03:35 AM] kingofcats#9205
i swear everyone did back in those days


[07-Aug-21 03:35 AM] kingofcats#9205
ahahah


[07-Aug-21 03:35 AM] kingofcats#9205
i did ballet i think idk


[07-Aug-21 03:35 AM] kingofcats#9205
i don''t remember


[07-Aug-21 03:35 AM] kingofcats#9205
i can still do it, but it's best when you're in a pool


[07-Aug-21 03:35 AM] kingofcats#9205
soo much easier


[07-Aug-21 03:36 AM] kingofcats#9205
ohhh


[07-Aug-21 03:37 AM] kingofcats#9205
that actually makes sense


[07-Aug-21 03:37 AM] kingofcats#9205
you could also do it against a wall


[07-Aug-21 03:37 AM] kingofcats#9205
i honestly went through trial and error to do it


[07-Aug-21 03:38 AM] kingofcats#9205
but i also did basketball as a sport


[07-Aug-21 03:38 AM] kingofcats#9205
soooooooooo


[07-Aug-21 03:38 AM] kingofcats#9205
i can't say if sports were really my thing


[07-Aug-21 03:38 AM] kingofcats#9205
i just did them


[07-Aug-21 03:38 AM] kingofcats#9205
same


[07-Aug-21 03:39 AM] kingofcats#9205
i was only good at guarding


[07-Aug-21 03:39 AM] kingofcats#9205
i just didn't like doing offensive stuff


[07-Aug-21 03:40 AM] kingofcats#9205
honestly if i actually focused on cross country, my stamina would probably be better smh


[07-Aug-21 03:40 AM] kingofcats#9205
i think by the end of the season was when my stamina was just beginning to get good


[07-Aug-21 03:40 AM] kingofcats#9205
and then the season ended ahahahah


[07-Aug-21 03:40 AM] kingofcats#9205
i don't even know how i convinced myself to run 2 miles


[07-Aug-21 03:41 AM] kingofcats#9205
and the worst part was i had a friend who was shouting at me to run faster ahahah


[07-Aug-21 03:41 AM] kingofcats#9205
honestly 1 mile is so nice


[07-Aug-21 03:41 AM] kingofcats#9205
pfft i would actually slow down


[07-Aug-21 03:41 AM] kingofcats#9205
just to spite him ahahah


[07-Aug-21 03:42 AM] kingofcats#9205
oml the 400 m as a track event is so hardddddddddd


[07-Aug-21 03:42 AM] kingofcats#9205
i still remember doing training


[07-Aug-21 03:42 AM] kingofcats#9205
i'd have to do those weird things where you sprint 50 m and walk 50 m or something and go up by increments of 50 or something


[07-Aug-21 03:42 AM] kingofcats#9205
i ran a 3200 once


[07-Aug-21 03:42 AM] kingofcats#9205
it was horrid


[07-Aug-21 03:42 AM] kingofcats#9205
i did pretty good in 400


[07-Aug-21 03:43 AM] kingofcats#9205
and then i quit


[07-Aug-21 03:43 AM] kingofcats#9205
honestly lining up gives me anxiety


[07-Aug-21 03:43 AM] kingofcats#9205
i just get all freaked out being in line and stuff


[07-Aug-21 03:44 AM] kingofcats#9205
oh yeah, track definitely is like RUN RUN RUN


[07-Aug-21 03:44 AM] kingofcats#9205
i used to just watch people get smoked


[07-Aug-21 03:44 AM] kingofcats#9205
like one of the soccer players was in track and he would outsprint practically everyone in the 100m


[07-Aug-21 03:45 AM] kingofcats#9205
i find it hilarious


[07-Aug-21 03:45 AM] kingofcats#9205
also perhaps we should sleep


[07-Aug-21 03:45 AM] kingofcats#9205
ahahah


[07-Aug-21 03:45 AM] kingofcats#9205
like it's almost 4 am


[07-Aug-21 03:45 AM] kingofcats#9205
yes


[07-Aug-21 03:45 AM] kingofcats#9205
time flies


[07-Aug-21 03:45 AM] kingofcats#9205
because it's fun


[07-Aug-21 03:46 AM] kingofcats#9205
but i also need to zip it and sleep before i wake up tomorrow and bask in my regret like i did this morning


[07-Aug-21 03:46 AM] kingofcats#9205
i say that like it isn't already the next day


[07-Aug-21 03:46 AM] kingofcats#9205
it's fine


[07-Aug-21 03:46 AM] kingofcats#9205
because i'll probably start another long convo tomorrow :3


[07-Aug-21 03:46 AM] kingofcats#9205
ahahahahahah


[07-Aug-21 03:47 AM] kingofcats#9205
y e s and we can hang out more


[07-Aug-21 03:47 AM] kingofcats#9205

[07-Aug-21 12:53 PM] kingofcats#9205
i was going to just not wake up early but my mom was like we *have* to go outside and walk sooo i got dragged outside


[07-Aug-21 12:55 PM] kingofcats#9205
that‚Äôs hilarious


[07-Aug-21 12:55 PM] kingofcats#9205
you know what i find really weird about spotify, and yes it‚Äôs really random


[07-Aug-21 12:56 PM] kingofcats#9205
i set my language as english but it will still give me ads in spanish sometimes even though i don‚Äôt really understand spanish at all


[07-Aug-21 12:56 PM] kingofcats#9205
sure i took three years of spanish, but i also didn‚Äôt really understand it lmao


[07-Aug-21 12:57 PM] kingofcats#9205
i don‚Äôt do anything in spanish at all lmao


[07-Aug-21 12:57 PM] kingofcats#9205
the last time i googled spanish was for google translate


[07-Aug-21 12:58 PM] kingofcats#9205
my spanish 3 teacher really thought i knew how to write essays but none of us learned how to in spanish 2


[07-Aug-21 12:58 PM] kingofcats#9205
lmaooo idk how the ad algorithms work either


[07-Aug-21 12:59 PM] kingofcats#9205
youtube likes to give me men‚Äôs deodorant ads lmfao


[07-Aug-21 12:59 PM] kingofcats#9205
i swear every foreign language teacher assumes you can write essays at a certain point


[07-Aug-21 01:02 PM] kingofcats#9205
okayyy lmao


[07-Aug-21 01:02 PM] kingofcats#9205
don‚Äôt get carsick ;w;


[07-Aug-21 06:07 PM] kingofcats#9205

[07-Aug-21 06:11 PM] kingofcats#9205
lmaoooo that‚Äôs great!!!


[07-Aug-21 06:12 PM] kingofcats#9205
aaaaaaaaa that sounds p long for a walk


[07-Aug-21 06:13 PM] kingofcats#9205
especially if you haven‚Äôt been walking much


[07-Aug-21 06:13 PM] kingofcats#9205
ngl i don‚Äôt go outside most days of the week myself ahaha


[07-Aug-21 06:14 PM] kingofcats#9205
fr fr!!! i swear i get more exercise when school is in-person


[07-Aug-21 06:14 PM] kingofcats#9205
otherwise i‚Äôm like, i‚Äôll just stay indoors


[07-Aug-21 06:15 PM] kingofcats#9205
lmaooo


[07-Aug-21 06:15 PM] kingofcats#9205
i feel like it‚Äôs such a hassle going outside


[07-Aug-21 06:16 PM] kingofcats#9205
my parents are like wear a mask, wipe your hands every time you get back to the car, wash them when you get home, wipe everything you buy


[07-Aug-21 06:16 PM] kingofcats#9205
i felt that sooooo hard


[07-Aug-21 06:16 PM] kingofcats#9205
i swear my doctor is secretly thinking that this is exactly why i have a vitamin d deficiency


[07-Aug-21 06:18 PM] kingofcats#9205
i was supposed to start taking them way back in 6th grade after i went to my doctor about wrist pain


[07-Aug-21 06:18 PM] kingofcats#9205
i had to get examined pretty thoroughly cause she was convinced i either had arthritis or carpal tunnel


[07-Aug-21 06:18 PM] kingofcats#9205
but then they did bloodwork ig and i had a vitamin d deficiency


[07-Aug-21 06:19 PM] kingofcats#9205
ofc i constantly forget to take the pills lmfao


[07-Aug-21 06:19 PM] kingofcats#9205
well she prescribed painkillers that didn‚Äôt work soooooo i guess that was why she thought that?


[07-Aug-21 06:20 PM] kingofcats#9205
m e


[07-Aug-21 06:20 PM] kingofcats#9205
i have like two i have to take daily


[07-Aug-21 06:20 PM] kingofcats#9205
and one of them is like an inch long


[07-Aug-21 06:21 PM] kingofcats#9205
i have no idea honestly


[07-Aug-21 06:21 PM] kingofcats#9205
i guess it was cause it wasn‚Äôt something painkillers could help with??? idk but it got better because of the vitamin d supplements lmao


[07-Aug-21 06:22 PM] kingofcats#9205
i‚Äôm gonna have to take two giant bottles of supplements with me and my melatonin ahaha


[07-Aug-21 06:23 PM] kingofcats#9205
my parents bought it for me after a psychiatrist said to i think, or something


[07-Aug-21 06:23 PM] kingofcats#9205
it‚Äôs nice when i messed up my sleep schedule and need to brute force fix it


[07-Aug-21 06:24 PM] kingofcats#9205
which is exactly what i need to do today


[07-Aug-21 06:24 PM] kingofcats#9205
i went out, came home and napped soooo i just woke up a few minutes agoo


[07-Aug-21 06:25 PM] kingofcats#9205
yeah don‚Äôt overtake


[07-Aug-21 06:25 PM] kingofcats#9205
i knew someone who took a bunch of high dosage melatonin and at some point it just stopped working


[07-Aug-21 06:26 PM] kingofcats#9205
so def be careful about taking too much cause the stronger sleep meds are illegal here i think or at the very least, extremely difficult to obtain


[07-Aug-21 06:26 PM] kingofcats#9205
at least from what i‚Äôve heard


[07-Aug-21 06:27 PM] kingofcats#9205
oh it‚Äôs weird as heck when it kicks in


[07-Aug-21 06:28 PM] kingofcats#9205
it kinda feels like when you‚Äôre sick and you took medicine and you‚Äôre slowly getting increasingly tired


[07-Aug-21 06:28 PM] kingofcats#9205
and then you‚Äôre guaranteed around 5 hours i think


[07-Aug-21 06:28 PM] kingofcats#9205
but it‚Äôs not like it instantly kicks in


[07-Aug-21 06:29 PM] kingofcats#9205
ahhhhh being sick sucksssss


[07-Aug-21 06:29 PM] kingofcats#9205
another reason why i don‚Äôt go outside


[07-Aug-21 06:30 PM] kingofcats#9205
i really skipped getting sick all of my senior year and i was soooo happy


[07-Aug-21 06:30 PM] kingofcats#9205
especially when i got to skip flu season i was overjoyed :3


[07-Aug-21 06:31 PM] kingofcats#9205
good luckkkkkkkkk


[07-Aug-21 07:23 PM] kingofcats#9205
yayyyyyyy jennyyyyy


[07-Aug-21 07:23 PM] kingofcats#9205
i can keep you company while i do my aps ahahah


[07-Aug-21 07:25 PM] kingofcats#9205
i'm telling myself i have to get it done


[07-Aug-21 07:25 PM] kingofcats#9205
i spent all of high school procrastinating


[07-Aug-21 07:25 PM] kingofcats#9205
and i have some pretty interesting stories from that


[07-Aug-21 07:25 PM] kingofcats#9205
so needless to say, i'm trying to get it together and not do that through all of college ahahah


[07-Aug-21 07:29 PM] kingofcats#9205
i procrastinated on a whap shower curtain and ended up ruining a decent jacket over it


[07-Aug-21 07:29 PM] kingofcats#9205
so i'm trying not to have a repeat of that in college


[07-Aug-21 07:29 PM] kingofcats#9205
i just realized i also semi-slept through the star wars unit of my whap class and some of my english classes before


[07-Aug-21 07:44 PM] kingofcats#9205
did no one else take whap and have to do a giant shower curtain?


[07-Aug-21 07:44 PM] kingofcats#9205
as for star wars, my teacher had us watch it to learn how to write the long essays questions and the saqs


[07-Aug-21 07:45 PM] kingofcats#9205
apparently it had all the proper components for a response that would get you a good score


[07-Aug-21 07:46 PM] kingofcats#9205
but i really just kinda slept through part of the star wars thing


[07-Aug-21 07:46 PM] kingofcats#9205
although my teacher was a *huge* star wars fan, as in he had boba fett tattooed on his arm


[07-Aug-21 07:47 PM] kingofcats#9205
so maybe he just chose star wars cause he liked it a bunch ahahah

{Reactions}
üòÜ 

[07-Aug-21 07:50 PM] kingofcats#9205
honestly though i can understand star wars being unique


[07-Aug-21 07:50 PM] kingofcats#9205
but i swear it wasn't just me who had to do the giant shower curtain thing

i had to go out and buy a giant shower curtain in like april or may to use it for the project


[07-Aug-21 07:52 PM] kingofcats#9205
and then i kinda procrastinated until like 11 pm and stayed up until 5 am doing the project and at some point i absentmindedly messed up and one of my sleeves turned pitch black and my arm got stained too


[07-Aug-21 07:52 PM] kingofcats#9205
all because i rested my arm on an uncapped black sharpie


[07-Aug-21 07:52 PM] kingofcats#9205
ofc i finished the giant shower curtain and managed to turn it in just fine and got a decent grade on it


[07-Aug-21 07:52 PM] kingofcats#9205
but i ruined a decent jacket over it


[07-Aug-21 07:53 PM] kingofcats#9205
yeah and the jacket was my basketball one :p


[07-Aug-21 07:53 PM] kingofcats#9205
thank goodness my season was over or i'd have to explain the giant black stain of sharpie that wouldn't come out


[07-Aug-21 07:53 PM] kingofcats#9205
y e s


[07-Aug-21 07:54 PM] kingofcats#9205
i used to hear my english teachers in high school tell people not to procrastinate on the essays


[07-Aug-21 07:54 PM] kingofcats#9205
and then there was me who also put it off and took like 4-5 hours to write one essay and turn it in


[07-Aug-21 07:54 PM] kingofcats#9205
i don't know if they actually knew i was doing the essay last minute or not though


[07-Aug-21 08:05 PM] kingofcats#9205
jennyyyyyyyyyy, how's the event?


[07-Aug-21 08:20 PM] kingofcats#9205
riiiiiight?


[07-Aug-21 08:21 PM] kingofcats#9205
that's niceeeee :3


[07-Aug-21 08:21 PM] kingofcats#9205
also lowkey, i think my teachers know cause i turn things in at such odd hours


[07-Aug-21 08:21 PM] kingofcats#9205
it'll be four am and my essay will just be submitted


[07-Aug-21 08:21 PM] kingofcats#9205
i have a trick for that


[07-Aug-21 08:21 PM] kingofcats#9205
i just preset my send


[07-Aug-21 08:22 PM] kingofcats#9205
i'll have emails sending at 8 am when i'm fast asleep ahahah


[07-Aug-21 08:22 PM] kingofcats#9205
ahahahah


[07-Aug-21 08:23 PM] kingofcats#9205
i usually have things in at weird times since i actually feel motivated for whatever reason at weird hours


[07-Aug-21 08:23 PM] kingofcats#9205
i think that by the end of high school, my teachers just kinda stopped asking questions about why in the world i was up at like 2 am


[07-Aug-21 08:24 PM] kingofcats#9205
that's why i liked timed essays so muchhhhhhhhhh


[07-Aug-21 08:24 PM] kingofcats#9205
i seriously can't think of anything to write when i'm trying to write an essay early usually


[07-Aug-21 08:24 PM] kingofcats#9205
i have an unimaginable amount of run on sentences


[07-Aug-21 08:24 PM] kingofcats#9205
it's not even a joke


[07-Aug-21 08:25 PM] kingofcats#9205
i try really hard not to, but it happens so muchhhhh


[07-Aug-21 08:25 PM] kingofcats#9205
oml i try not to let my sentences get too long


[07-Aug-21 08:26 PM] kingofcats#9205
but i got into a bad habit of writing exceedingly long sentences with no real idea of when i should stop the sentence


[07-Aug-21 08:26 PM] kingofcats#9205
i used to get in so much trouble for having like 10 different run ons


[07-Aug-21 08:27 PM] kingofcats#9205
i don't get how anyone writes essays without run ons


[07-Aug-21 08:27 PM] kingofcats#9205
that is so true


[07-Aug-21 08:28 PM] kingofcats#9205
but also when i usually write, it's not for schoolwork so i created a bunch of really really really bad habits


[07-Aug-21 08:28 PM] kingofcats#9205
yessssssss


[07-Aug-21 08:28 PM] kingofcats#9205
what about youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu


[07-Aug-21 08:29 PM] kingofcats#9205
lmao do you have any other hobbies? :3


[07-Aug-21 08:29 PM] kingofcats#9205
oml i could neverrrrrrrrrrr


[07-Aug-21 08:29 PM] kingofcats#9205
ohhhhhhh that's so cool


[07-Aug-21 08:30 PM] kingofcats#9205
there's this stage apparently near 6th that does karaoke?


[07-Aug-21 08:30 PM] kingofcats#9205
or maybe i just don't remember which college correctly ahahah


[07-Aug-21 08:30 PM] kingofcats#9205
i think i've only ever written 150 ish pages


[07-Aug-21 08:30 PM] kingofcats#9205
but i have hit 200 pages compiling recipes i found interesting


[07-Aug-21 08:31 PM] kingofcats#9205
i think cookbooks are one of the faster ways to have an insane amount of pages


[07-Aug-21 08:31 PM] kingofcats#9205
honestly, i don't know how to cook, i just follow the instructions


[07-Aug-21 08:31 PM] kingofcats#9205
it works out just fine


[07-Aug-21 08:32 PM] kingofcats#9205
wait jennyyyyyyyyyyy


[07-Aug-21 08:32 PM] kingofcats#9205
what shows have you been watchinggg


[07-Aug-21 08:32 PM] kingofcats#9205
ahahah cdramas


[07-Aug-21 08:33 PM] kingofcats#9205
i admire your patience


[07-Aug-21 08:33 PM] kingofcats#9205
my parents used to have me watch those taiwanese tv shows and ahklajdfks


[07-Aug-21 08:33 PM] kingofcats#9205
i would just be like "HURRY UP AND GET TOGETHER, IT'S SO OBVIOUS YOU TWO WILL DATE"


[07-Aug-21 08:34 PM] kingofcats#9205
fr fr


[07-Aug-21 08:34 PM] kingofcats#9205
n o


[07-Aug-21 08:35 PM] kingofcats#9205
i felt that


[07-Aug-21 08:35 PM] kingofcats#9205
honestly i'm kinda surprised no one has joined us yetttttttttt


[07-Aug-21 08:36 PM] kingofcats#9205
honestly i have no idea


[07-Aug-21 08:36 PM] kingofcats#9205
i mean there are so manyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy


[07-Aug-21 08:37 PM] kingofcats#9205
it's like high school clubs x 100 i swear


[07-Aug-21 08:37 PM] kingofcats#9205
let's be real, i didn't join any clubs in high school


[07-Aug-21 08:37 PM] kingofcats#9205
i didn't join any clubs at the community college i was at either


[07-Aug-21 08:38 PM] kingofcats#9205
i don't think clubs were as important as people thought they were


[07-Aug-21 08:38 PM] kingofcats#9205
my honors bio teacher had an anime club that i occasionally crashed


[07-Aug-21 08:39 PM] kingofcats#9205
i remember she liked one piece


[07-Aug-21 08:39 PM] kingofcats#9205
oh i have a horror story about a club leader


[07-Aug-21 08:39 PM] kingofcats#9205
it's not like horror horror


[07-Aug-21 08:39 PM] kingofcats#9205
but man it sucked


[07-Aug-21 08:40 PM] kingofcats#9205
so this kid was a freshman in my chem honors class cause he apparently took a bio class at harker summer before school started and he made a science club which he claimed would be amazing


[07-Aug-21 08:40 PM] kingofcats#9205
ofc i ended up joining cause i was interested and he said he wanted to be a cardiothoracic surgeon and i thought perhaps there would be dissections and fun things


[07-Aug-21 08:40 PM] kingofcats#9205
instead, i found out we were studying


[07-Aug-21 08:41 PM] kingofcats#9205
yes, *studying*


[07-Aug-21 08:41 PM] kingofcats#9205
and it wasn't like the normal stuff we learn in high school, we were studying for the national science bowl for whatever reason


[07-Aug-21 08:41 PM] kingofcats#9205
and the most "fun" thing he did was a project where people made ovens out of old pizza boxes and tinfoil which is something you can do as a child


[07-Aug-21 08:41 PM] kingofcats#9205
the national science bowl stuff is the horror


[07-Aug-21 08:41 PM] kingofcats#9205
it lives in my nightmares


[07-Aug-21 08:42 PM] kingofcats#9205
everything there was so abstract and weird


[07-Aug-21 08:42 PM] kingofcats#9205
nope


[07-Aug-21 08:42 PM] kingofcats#9205
i ditched shortly afterwards despite him trying to get me stay for a bit


[07-Aug-21 08:43 PM] kingofcats#9205
ig it had something to do with me being decent at chem + bio but like no way was i going to study some weird abstract stuff when our team was weaksauce


[07-Aug-21 08:43 PM] kingofcats#9205
they spent a few months and then went to competition and then lost within the first round


[07-Aug-21 08:44 PM] kingofcats#9205
apparently the club is still around


[07-Aug-21 08:44 PM] kingofcats#9205
that i don't know


[07-Aug-21 08:45 PM] kingofcats#9205
i highly doubt they went too far in the competition though


[07-Aug-21 08:45 PM] kingofcats#9205
there were a lot of other school within our bracket that could easily beat them out


[07-Aug-21 08:46 PM] kingofcats#9205
the only two extracurriculars at my school that were clubs and actually good at what they did would be mock trial and robotics


[07-Aug-21 08:46 PM] kingofcats#9205
in my sophomore year the school's mock trial went to state, i think


[07-Aug-21 08:46 PM] kingofcats#9205
and robotics went to worlds in texas


[07-Aug-21 08:47 PM] kingofcats#9205
i think the only other club i can remember being relatively remarkable was the math & physics tutoring club


[07-Aug-21 08:47 PM] kingofcats#9205
but yeah, most of the clubs at my school were random though i think we had an esports club


[07-Aug-21 08:47 PM] kingofcats#9205
and we had a nintendo club for one year


[07-Aug-21 08:48 PM] kingofcats#9205
oml thoseeee


[07-Aug-21 08:48 PM] kingofcats#9205
weren't they popular in elementary school?


[07-Aug-21 08:48 PM] kingofcats#9205
that was sooooo long ago i swear


[07-Aug-21 08:49 PM] kingofcats#9205
oml rainbow loom?


[07-Aug-21 08:49 PM] kingofcats#9205
that's been so longggggggggg


[07-Aug-21 08:50 PM] kingofcats#9205
the only really interesting that happened during my elementary school days was i had a bunch of overnight trips starting in 3rd grade


[07-Aug-21 08:50 PM] kingofcats#9205
so i can safely say i've been to a farm and smelled what farm smells like


[07-Aug-21 08:51 PM] kingofcats#9205
i just remember my overnight trips cause i had two each year including my 6th grade


[07-Aug-21 08:51 PM] kingofcats#9205
i actually kinda know where that is


[07-Aug-21 08:51 PM] kingofcats#9205
i used to have beach trips for three years straight


[07-Aug-21 08:52 PM] kingofcats#9205
we'd camp somewhere and then go to the beach during the day


[07-Aug-21 08:52 PM] kingofcats#9205
it was during the fall, around october-november i think when we'd go


[07-Aug-21 08:52 PM] kingofcats#9205
so it was cold as heckkkkk


[07-Aug-21 08:52 PM] kingofcats#9205
omg i hate camping for that same reason


[07-Aug-21 08:52 PM] kingofcats#9205
i remember my 4th grade trip was gold country so we went to somewhere in norcal


[07-Aug-21 08:53 PM] kingofcats#9205
no wait


[07-Aug-21 08:53 PM] kingofcats#9205
that was my 5th grade 2nd overnight


[07-Aug-21 08:53 PM] kingofcats#9205
my fourth grade's non-beach trip was the one where we went to mendocino


[07-Aug-21 08:53 PM] kingofcats#9205
and the car ride suckedddddddddddd


[07-Aug-21 08:53 PM] kingofcats#9205
i think everyone got slightly carsick


[07-Aug-21 08:53 PM] kingofcats#9205
and we lived in cabins in the woods and there were bugs


[07-Aug-21 08:53 PM] kingofcats#9205
and i saw a banana slug and screamed


[07-Aug-21 08:53 PM] kingofcats#9205
ahahah


[07-Aug-21 08:54 PM] kingofcats#9205
and kiss them


[07-Aug-21 08:54 PM] kingofcats#9205
and i'd just stare at them grossed out


[07-Aug-21 08:54 PM] kingofcats#9205
and there were also creeks and people would really play in them even though there were water skeeters on the water


[07-Aug-21 08:54 PM] kingofcats#9205
my hatred for banana slugs is exactly why i couldn't attend ucsc ahahah


[07-Aug-21 08:55 PM] kingofcats#9205
although it wasn't as bad as the invitation i got last year from  a school whose mascot was a spider


[07-Aug-21 08:55 PM] kingofcats#9205
and they really said they thought they could see me as a spider i-


[07-Aug-21 08:55 PM] kingofcats#9205
yesssssssssssssssssssssssss


[07-Aug-21 08:55 PM] kingofcats#9205
yesssssssss


[07-Aug-21 08:56 PM] kingofcats#9205
i just realized my two high school friends who are at ucs are bears


[07-Aug-21 08:56 PM] kingofcats#9205
like both of them


[07-Aug-21 08:57 PM] kingofcats#9205
ucla is also a bear


[07-Aug-21 08:57 PM] kingofcats#9205
and then ucsb is a black big cat who wears a funny hat i think


[07-Aug-21 08:57 PM] kingofcats#9205
and then there's another uc with a dude who has a big cheesy grin


[07-Aug-21 08:57 PM] kingofcats#9205
at least i think there is idk


[07-Aug-21 08:58 PM] kingofcats#9205
uci is anteater


[07-Aug-21 08:58 PM] kingofcats#9205
lmaooooo


[07-Aug-21 08:59 PM] kingofcats#9205
i don't know how people keep friendships when they're at different schools ngl


[07-Aug-21 08:59 PM] kingofcats#9205
but i did tell my friend at ucla we should meet up sometime


[07-Aug-21 08:59 PM] kingofcats#9205
and my friend who's going to u of toronto promised to drop by and visit me in sd :3


[07-Aug-21 09:00 PM] kingofcats#9205
ahahahah my friend who's going to u of t moved away to seattle and there's a cat cafe there


[07-Aug-21 09:00 PM] kingofcats#9205
and ig they haven't visited it yet cause i didn't get pictures yet ahahah


[07-Aug-21 09:00 PM] kingofcats#9205
honestly toronto is super farrrrrrrrrrrrrrr


[07-Aug-21 09:01 PM] kingofcats#9205
same


[07-Aug-21 09:01 PM] kingofcats#9205
honestly  i don't know my geography too well


[07-Aug-21 09:01 PM] kingofcats#9205
so i just found that out now ahahahh


[07-Aug-21 09:01 PM] kingofcats#9205
but it's all good


[07-Aug-21 09:02 PM] kingofcats#9205
cause i promised i'd visit them sometime cause i wanna try poutine


[07-Aug-21 09:02 PM] kingofcats#9205
that's super coollllllllllll


[07-Aug-21 09:02 PM] kingofcats#9205
i have a bunch


[07-Aug-21 09:03 PM] kingofcats#9205
and i usually stop talking to them after a while which is sad


[07-Aug-21 09:03 PM] kingofcats#9205
buuuut i don't think that's gonna happen with my guild because i really don't stop talking


[07-Aug-21 09:03 PM] kingofcats#9205
time zones really mess things up though


[07-Aug-21 09:03 PM] kingofcats#9205
cause some of my friends are in se asia or something


[07-Aug-21 09:03 PM] kingofcats#9205
fr f r


[07-Aug-21 09:05 PM] kingofcats#9205
my mom always tells me my time is upside down in chinese


[07-Aug-21 09:05 PM] kingofcats#9205
and like honestly, yeah


[07-Aug-21 09:05 PM] kingofcats#9205
i do tend to have my times flipped


[07-Aug-21 09:05 PM] kingofcats#9205
i have a friend in taiwan but i also don't talk to her much ahahah


[07-Aug-21 09:06 PM] kingofcats#9205
oml yesssssssssssss


[07-Aug-21 09:06 PM] kingofcats#9205
i wanna go to japan


[07-Aug-21 09:06 PM] kingofcats#9205
everything looks so pretty there


[07-Aug-21 09:06 PM] kingofcats#9205
especially the food


[07-Aug-21 09:06 PM] kingofcats#9205
honestly now i have an actual reason to be up at odd hours since some of my friends from my guild like haikyuu and they're in a diff timezone


[07-Aug-21 09:07 PM] kingofcats#9205
fr fr


[07-Aug-21 09:07 PM] kingofcats#9205
which is exactly why i should learn some japanese


[07-Aug-21 09:07 PM] kingofcats#9205
y e s


[07-Aug-21 09:08 PM] kingofcats#9205
i picked up more japanese from the japanese medical tv show i watch than i do from animes, oddly enough


[07-Aug-21 09:08 PM] kingofcats#9205
whenever i watch animes i usually just end up remembering what the subs say, not the actual japanese lmfao


[07-Aug-21 09:09 PM] kingofcats#9205
definitely


[07-Aug-21 09:09 PM] kingofcats#9205
especially since haikyuu has some dialects


[07-Aug-21 09:09 PM] kingofcats#9205
like the miya twins speak in i think the kansai dialect


[07-Aug-21 09:09 PM] kingofcats#9205
so they kinda speak a bit different


[07-Aug-21 09:10 PM] kingofcats#9205
i picked up a bit of korean from binging an idol competition or something


[07-Aug-21 09:10 PM] kingofcats#9205
although i knew how to say good morning cause i had a teacher in elementary school who liked to have people do good mornings in different languages so everyone learned something new ig


[07-Aug-21 09:10 PM] kingofcats#9205
i watched the unit, not produce 101 lmao


[07-Aug-21 09:11 PM] kingofcats#9205
i don't know how i got into it, but i ended up hooked


[07-Aug-21 09:11 PM] kingofcats#9205
yesssssssssssss


[07-Aug-21 09:12 PM] kingofcats#9205
lmaooooooo


[07-Aug-21 09:12 PM] kingofcats#9205
i feel like sometimes you don't mean to enjoy something as much as you do


[07-Aug-21 09:12 PM] kingofcats#9205
but then when you find out it's just hard to stop


[07-Aug-21 09:13 PM] kingofcats#9205
i remember i had this phase where i thought premed and neurosurgery was so cool


[07-Aug-21 09:13 PM] kingofcats#9205
and then i read when breath becomes air


[07-Aug-21 09:13 PM] kingofcats#9205
and it was so sad but i liked it so much? so i bought a copy


[07-Aug-21 09:13 PM] kingofcats#9205
wait jennyyyyyyy


[07-Aug-21 09:14 PM] kingofcats#9205
have you ever read or seen where'd you go bernadette?


[07-Aug-21 09:15 PM] kingofcats#9205
honestly i really enjoyed it


[07-Aug-21 09:15 PM] kingofcats#9205
i'm probably going to rewatch it when i'm at ucsd lmao


[07-Aug-21 09:15 PM] kingofcats#9205
same with stick it


[07-Aug-21 09:15 PM] kingofcats#9205
wait jenny what have you read?


[07-Aug-21 09:15 PM] kingofcats#9205
like what's classic fiction for you?


[07-Aug-21 09:16 PM] kingofcats#9205
ahhhhhhh sameeee


[07-Aug-21 09:16 PM] kingofcats#9205
i'm already blocking out when his birthday stream is tomorrow ahahah


[07-Aug-21 09:16 PM] kingofcats#9205
my priorities are so whacked out


[07-Aug-21 09:17 PM] kingofcats#9205
i'm honestly excited because i was at his first twitch which happened last month


[07-Aug-21 09:17 PM] kingofcats#9205
and it was really fun honestly


[07-Aug-21 09:18 PM] kingofcats#9205
although i do hope he finishes resi 8


[07-Aug-21 09:18 PM] kingofcats#9205
yeah they really do


[07-Aug-21 09:18 PM] kingofcats#9205
some of them are soooo long


[07-Aug-21 09:18 PM] kingofcats#9205
it was like 4-5 hours of streaming  i think


[07-Aug-21 09:19 PM] kingofcats#9205
oml college app season ahahahahahahahah


[07-Aug-21 09:19 PM] kingofcats#9205
mine was such a disaster


[07-Aug-21 09:19 PM] kingofcats#9205
i honestly just read manga instead of writing my supps


[07-Aug-21 09:19 PM] kingofcats#9205
omllllllllll that's wild


[07-Aug-21 09:19 PM] kingofcats#9205
i don't even know how i survived last year


[07-Aug-21 09:20 PM] kingofcats#9205
ahahah my mom is the one who handles the questions


[07-Aug-21 09:20 PM] kingofcats#9205
but i also wasn't close with any of my underclassmen so no one asks me about stuff like that


[07-Aug-21 09:21 PM] kingofcats#9205
the only app essays i'll be looking at are my other childhood friend's essays, maybe and that's cause he's the son of my mom's bestie from high school


[07-Aug-21 09:22 PM] kingofcats#9205
at least for this season


[07-Aug-21 09:22 PM] kingofcats#9205
i read so many  fanfics that i know what bad storytelling sounds like


[07-Aug-21 09:23 PM] kingofcats#9205
i spent my last year of high school reading manga and fanfics


[07-Aug-21 09:23 PM] kingofcats#9205
i think it depends on the fandom really, the quality is all over the place

content is the only thing i can actually help with


[07-Aug-21 09:23 PM] kingofcats#9205
yessssssssssss


[07-Aug-21 09:24 PM] kingofcats#9205
i will say that tags really cull the herd, that and how they summarize


[07-Aug-21 09:24 PM] kingofcats#9205
usually you can tell how experienced an author is from the way they summarize, tag and other stuff


[07-Aug-21 09:25 PM] kingofcats#9205
the ones who write on tumblr as well as ao3 tend to have better content from what i've noticed


[07-Aug-21 09:25 PM] kingofcats#9205
i've also noticed a bunch of wattpad writers tend to like those weird looking fonts


[07-Aug-21 09:25 PM] kingofcats#9205
honestly i have seen some decent all lowercase fics


[07-Aug-21 09:26 PM] kingofcats#9205
i don't usually go on tumblr either ahahah


[07-Aug-21 09:26 PM] kingofcats#9205
i mean they don't


[07-Aug-21 09:26 PM] kingofcats#9205
somehow they have these html copy paste ones


[07-Aug-21 09:26 PM] kingofcats#9205
yessssssssssssssss


[07-Aug-21 09:27 PM] kingofcats#9205
oml sameeeeeeee


[07-Aug-21 09:28 PM] kingofcats#9205
i gotta wrap that up


[07-Aug-21 09:29 PM] kingofcats#9205
i mean


[07-Aug-21 09:29 PM] kingofcats#9205
it's not graded lmaooooooo


[07-Aug-21 09:29 PM] kingofcats#9205
i'm just going to answer with whatever comes out of my brain


[07-Aug-21 09:34 PM] kingofcats#9205
ngl i'm approaching it the same way i approach essays


[07-Aug-21 09:35 PM] kingofcats#9205
i just write without too much thought and usually things make lots of sense


[07-Aug-21 09:35 PM] kingofcats#9205
now i'm kinda curious, are you the type of person who plans out an essay or one who just writes one without any planning or outlining?


[07-Aug-21 09:35 PM] kingofcats#9205
actually if anyone else wants to answer this question, please do


[07-Aug-21 09:46 PM] kingofcats#9205
yeah!!! is anyone else here??? ;w;


[07-Aug-21 09:47 PM] kingofcats#9205
s a m e
my brain does it fine as i'm working through the essay and it sounds so much more cohesive than it would if i was trying to hit all the points i planned out


[07-Aug-21 09:54 PM] kingofcats#9205
did you mean the aps discussion yesterday? if so i didn't download any files, i just wrote down what was relevant to the questions and that was it lmao


[07-Aug-21 09:56 PM] kingofcats#9205
yeah sometimes you end up needing some weird thing to open files


[07-Aug-21 09:56 PM] kingofcats#9205
i also noticed sometimes the files end up downloaded or uploaded as weird files


[07-Aug-21 09:57 PM] kingofcats#9205
the only stuff i have written down is that chart he drew of the 33 coin problem


[07-Aug-21 09:58 PM] kingofcats#9205
oml i had to set up snagit on this laptop since it's new
the one i was going to buy still hasn't been released yet so this is my interim laptop ahahah


[07-Aug-21 09:58 PM] kingofcats#9205
i mean i also have the stuff he said about 1b + 1c


[07-Aug-21 10:01 PM] kingofcats#9205
yeah the windows computers have this built in screenshotter known as snipping tool


[07-Aug-21 10:01 PM] kingofcats#9205
but i find it kinda tiring to use since i don't think it has a hotkey


[07-Aug-21 10:01 PM] kingofcats#9205
so i had my dad download snagit since it lets me set a hotkey


[07-Aug-21 10:02 PM] kingofcats#9205
so were you able to open the file or do you want me to share a pic of the notes i took lmao


[07-Aug-21 10:04 PM] kingofcats#9205
okayyyyyyyyyyyy that's goodddd :3


[07-Aug-21 10:05 PM] kingofcats#9205
functions like math functions


[07-Aug-21 10:05 PM] kingofcats#9205
or functions like programming functions


[07-Aug-21 10:06 PM] kingofcats#9205
i still kinda remember math functions


[07-Aug-21 10:13 PM] kingofcats#9205

[07-Aug-21 10:13 PM] kingofcats#9205

[07-Aug-21 10:16 PM] kingofcats#9205

[07-Aug-21 10:16 PM] kingofcats#9205

[07-Aug-21 10:41 PM] kingofcats#9205

[07-Aug-21 11:49 PM] kingofcats#9205
i spent some of the time on aps but rn i've been renaming my playlists on spotify


[07-Aug-21 11:49 PM] kingofcats#9205
and some of them have such dumb names now


[07-Aug-21 11:49 PM] kingofcats#9205
lewis capaldi


[07-Aug-21 11:50 PM] kingofcats#9205
i swear he sings angst i-


[07-Aug-21 11:50 PM] kingofcats#9205
also i felt that so hard


[07-Aug-21 11:50 PM] kingofcats#9205
wait jenny have you heard some of the unreleased ed sheeran stuff?


[07-Aug-21 11:50 PM] kingofcats#9205
he was on yesterday and he kept saying he was gonna release these two songs from the film but he never did


[07-Aug-21 11:50 PM] kingofcats#9205
i-


[07-Aug-21 11:50 PM] kingofcats#9205
i was waiting for penguins and one life to become singles or something


[07-Aug-21 11:50 PM] kingofcats#9205
and he never did


[07-Aug-21 11:51 PM] kingofcats#9205
i just really liked those two songs in particular lmao


[07-Aug-21 11:51 PM] kingofcats#9205
they're only on yt tho


[07-Aug-21 11:51 PM] kingofcats#9205
which suckssssssssss


[07-Aug-21 11:51 PM] kingofcats#9205
but i only really keep up with corpse at this point lmfao


[07-Aug-21 11:52 PM] kingofcats#9205
man new laptops are such a pain


[07-Aug-21 11:52 PM] kingofcats#9205
so glad my dad loaded all the important stuff of mine onto a hardrive


[07-Aug-21 11:52 PM] kingofcats#9205
that is so fairrrrrrrrrrr


[07-Aug-21 11:52 PM] kingofcats#9205
lmao


[07-Aug-21 11:52 PM] kingofcats#9205
but yeah i def get corpse being intense


[07-Aug-21 11:52 PM] kingofcats#9205
i think his least intense song is probably agoraphobic


[07-Aug-21 11:53 PM] kingofcats#9205
although he does have new stuff coming sometime


[07-Aug-21 11:53 PM] kingofcats#9205
soft songs are so niceeeee


[07-Aug-21 11:53 PM] kingofcats#9205
i think i found most of my soft songs from one of those remix youtube channels


[07-Aug-21 11:54 PM] kingofcats#9205
lmao ballads


[07-Aug-21 11:54 PM] kingofcats#9205
i have this really random taste


[07-Aug-21 11:54 PM] kingofcats#9205
at first it'll be k/da or something and then musicals and then sea shanties


[07-Aug-21 11:55 PM] kingofcats#9205
okay but if you're into like bass singers


[07-Aug-21 11:55 PM] kingofcats#9205
i have a rec, he does covers on youtube


[07-Aug-21 11:55 PM] kingofcats#9205
and his bass is quite nice


[07-Aug-21 11:55 PM] kingofcats#9205
not like corpse deep


[07-Aug-21 11:55 PM] kingofcats#9205
colm mcguinness?


[07-Aug-21 11:56 PM] kingofcats#9205
i got a little too into sea shanties cause i was listening to reinaery


[07-Aug-21 11:56 PM] kingofcats#9205
and then he showed up


[07-Aug-21 11:57 PM] kingofcats#9205
i mean i learned a few on guitar years ago and wanted the nostalgia and then i got hooked to the bass


[07-Aug-21 11:58 PM] kingofcats#9205
i swear that song reminds me of my 6th grade days


[07-Aug-21 11:59 PM] kingofcats#9205
and then country roads & green day's boulevard of broken dreams is elementary school


[07-Aug-21 11:59 PM] kingofcats#9205
omg i was in choir in elementary school tooooooooooooooooooooo


[07-Aug-21 11:59 PM] kingofcats#9205
ahahah


[07-Aug-21 11:59 PM] kingofcats#9205
nah it was school choir lmfao


[07-Aug-21 11:59 PM] kingofcats#9205
i used to have to wake up so early for that


[08-Aug-21 12:00 AM] kingofcats#9205
i remember we sang once upon a december from anastasia once


[08-Aug-21 12:00 AM] kingofcats#9205
and back when 1D was getting huge, we sang a song from them


[08-Aug-21 12:00 AM] kingofcats#9205
and we sang the christmas in whoville thing though i think we messed that one up a bunch during practice


[08-Aug-21 12:00 AM] kingofcats#9205
i knowwww


[08-Aug-21 12:00 AM] kingofcats#9205
it's so weird thinking about how i willingly woke up early


[08-Aug-21 12:01 AM] kingofcats#9205
ahahahah


[08-Aug-21 12:01 AM] kingofcats#9205
i don't remember why i did it


[08-Aug-21 12:01 AM] kingofcats#9205
but we did sing a disney song


[08-Aug-21 12:02 AM] kingofcats#9205
omg i knew about 1D only cause we had to sing one of their songs and the daughter of the mom in charge of choir loved the band ig


[08-Aug-21 12:02 AM] kingofcats#9205
which is how it ended up on our song lineup


[08-Aug-21 12:02 AM] kingofcats#9205
we sang it during springtime or something


[08-Aug-21 12:03 AM] kingofcats#9205
i think it was "that's what makes you beautiful"


[08-Aug-21 12:03 AM] kingofcats#9205
lmfao


[08-Aug-21 12:03 AM] kingofcats#9205
ahahahahahahahahah


[08-Aug-21 12:04 AM] kingofcats#9205
i swear things were so simple back then


[08-Aug-21 12:04 AM] kingofcats#9205
no pandemic and less things to do


[08-Aug-21 12:04 AM] kingofcats#9205
honestly y e s


[08-Aug-21 12:05 AM] kingofcats#9205
life was so fun pre-hs


[08-Aug-21 12:05 AM] kingofcats#9205
then it was like 
S T R E S S


[08-Aug-21 12:06 AM] kingofcats#9205
high school's proper synonyms are pain and stress ahahah


[08-Aug-21 12:06 AM] kingofcats#9205
y e s


[08-Aug-21 12:06 AM] kingofcats#9205
oml it's like every day they wake up and choose to be blind


[08-Aug-21 12:06 AM] kingofcats#9205
i-


[08-Aug-21 12:07 AM] kingofcats#9205
yeah technicallyyyy but also technicalities are kinda eh


[08-Aug-21 12:09 AM] kingofcats#9205
honestly


[08-Aug-21 12:09 AM] kingofcats#9205
i just considering morning whenever i wake up


[08-Aug-21 12:09 AM] kingofcats#9205
:p


[08-Aug-21 12:09 AM] kingofcats#9205
also like yeah, idk what it is with school and sketchy things lmfao


[08-Aug-21 12:09 AM] kingofcats#9205
n o


[08-Aug-21 12:09 AM] kingofcats#9205
it's always whenever you wakeup


[08-Aug-21 12:10 AM] kingofcats#9205
cause it's morning somewhere else in the world aaaaaaaa


[08-Aug-21 12:10 AM] kingofcats#9205
jenny did you got to a public school or a private school?


[08-Aug-21 12:10 AM] kingofcats#9205
i swear most people i know always shit on private schools lmfao


[08-Aug-21 12:11 AM] kingofcats#9205
oh wow that's pretty cool!!!


[08-Aug-21 12:11 AM] kingofcats#9205
i think it really depends on the school tbh


[08-Aug-21 12:12 AM] kingofcats#9205
that's also a good point


[08-Aug-21 12:12 AM] kingofcats#9205
like i remember people saying that harker was an academically strong private school


[08-Aug-21 12:12 AM] kingofcats#9205
ohhhhhhhhhhhh


[08-Aug-21 12:12 AM] kingofcats#9205
that is indeed a very awkward thing


[08-Aug-21 12:12 AM] kingofcats#9205
i had a friend who went a catholic school and was like "i learned almost no science"


[08-Aug-21 12:13 AM] kingofcats#9205
yeah evolution is controversial, don't some states refuse to teach it?


[08-Aug-21 12:14 AM] kingofcats#9205
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh i felt that


[08-Aug-21 12:15 AM] kingofcats#9205
i've had teachers like that and they are so difficult


[08-Aug-21 12:15 AM] kingofcats#9205
i think i pissed off my 9th grade advisory teacher that way lmfao


[08-Aug-21 12:15 AM] kingofcats#9205
i don't feel sorry at all though


[08-Aug-21 12:16 AM] kingofcats#9205
i think he was a bit backwards to begin with


[08-Aug-21 12:16 AM] kingofcats#9205
he was just supposed to help us get oriented during the first month of school


[08-Aug-21 12:16 AM] kingofcats#9205
and i may or may not have said some interesting things that made him speechless


[08-Aug-21 12:17 AM] kingofcats#9205
well


[08-Aug-21 12:17 AM] kingofcats#9205
i think it'll make more sense if i just say what happened


[08-Aug-21 12:19 AM] kingofcats#9205
so he was talking about manners and stuff because i guess that's something he found really important and he was telling us about dating etiquette and i was like okay whatever
but my friend (the one who attended a catholic school & is going to u of t) and i were kinda just semi paying attention until he said something like "guys if a girl laughs at your jokes, it means they like you"
it was his fault for what happened afterwards cause he added a "right ladies?"
and i just lost it, i started laughing and he looked at me funny and asked if i had anything to say, and i said yeah sure i did 
and i told him "well, they could also feel bad for you"


[08-Aug-21 12:20 AM] kingofcats#9205
yeah and he stared at me flabbergasted as my friend and i burst into another round of hysterical laughter


[08-Aug-21 12:20 AM] kingofcats#9205
and we never saw him again since advisory ended that day


[08-Aug-21 12:21 AM] kingofcats#9205
ahahahahah he didn't disappear


[08-Aug-21 12:22 AM] kingofcats#9205
we just never had to see him again cause advisory was over


[08-Aug-21 12:22 AM] kingofcats#9205
i think since that day he never liked me as a student again though i'd never know cause he wasn't my english teacher


[08-Aug-21 12:23 AM] kingofcats#9205
lmfao it's one of the few times when i regret nothing


[08-Aug-21 12:23 AM] kingofcats#9205
he was backwards in that sense and honestly it was kinda weird


[08-Aug-21 12:23 AM] kingofcats#9205
i don't think people have to laugh with you, sometimes they can laugh at you


[08-Aug-21 12:24 AM] kingofcats#9205
so hearing that was just weirdly very funny


[08-Aug-21 12:24 AM] kingofcats#9205
sometimes i do it without thinking


[08-Aug-21 12:25 AM] kingofcats#9205
i mean in that situation i didn't have a choice cause everyone was staring lmfao


[08-Aug-21 12:25 AM] kingofcats#9205
but still i think there are def times it's better to say nothing


[08-Aug-21 12:25 AM] kingofcats#9205
it takes so long to think of good ones


[08-Aug-21 12:26 AM] kingofcats#9205
perhaps lmfao


[08-Aug-21 12:26 AM] kingofcats#9205
at the very least, it made for an interesting final advisory


[08-Aug-21 12:27 AM] kingofcats#9205
i feel like since it takes so long to come up with retorts, i usually just end up saying exactly what i'm thinking


[08-Aug-21 12:27 AM] kingofcats#9205
and then things like that happen


[08-Aug-21 12:28 AM] kingofcats#9205
i felt that


[08-Aug-21 12:28 AM] kingofcats#9205
there are times i strongly regret not saying something and being like "ur wrong"


[08-Aug-21 12:28 AM] kingofcats#9205
that's such a mood though


[08-Aug-21 12:28 AM] kingofcats#9205
wanting to say something and then panicking and changing it midway through


[08-Aug-21 12:29 AM] kingofcats#9205
i love making portmanteaus


[08-Aug-21 12:29 AM] kingofcats#9205
not me misspelling big words like portmanteaus


[08-Aug-21 12:30 AM] kingofcats#9205
talking is so hard sometimes i swearrrrrrrrrrrrrrr


[08-Aug-21 12:30 AM] kingofcats#9205
t r u e


[08-Aug-21 12:30 AM] kingofcats#9205
especially when you're trying to talk to someone for the first time????


[08-Aug-21 12:30 AM] kingofcats#9205
like i get all anxious and panicky


[08-Aug-21 12:31 AM] kingofcats#9205
omg speaking typos


[08-Aug-21 12:31 AM] kingofcats#9205
ahah i'm probably gonna steal that ahahah


[08-Aug-21 12:31 AM] kingofcats#9205
sometimes that happens


[08-Aug-21 12:32 AM] kingofcats#9205
omg i remember making portmanteaus of names too sometimes


[08-Aug-21 12:32 AM] kingofcats#9205
okayyyyyy


[08-Aug-21 12:32 AM] kingofcats#9205
yeah we had a fun group yesterday ;w;


[08-Aug-21 12:44 AM] kingofcats#9205

[08-Aug-21 12:44 AM] kingofcats#9205

[09-Aug-21 01:28 AM] kingofcats#9205

i like to ask before b/c i know some people are like really uncomfy


[09-Aug-21 01:29 AM] kingofcats#9205
i had a guy friend and people kept saying he liked me
i thought he didn't but it turns out he did cause i realized like three years later he kept trying to ask me out


[09-Aug-21 01:29 AM] kingofcats#9205
Y E S


[09-Aug-21 01:29 AM] kingofcats#9205
i am also really the type to randomly say "i love you platonically" to people


[09-Aug-21 01:29 AM] kingofcats#9205
just to remind them they're loved


[09-Aug-21 01:29 AM] kingofcats#9205

[09-Aug-21 01:30 AM] kingofcats#9205
because i don't want misconceptions


[09-Aug-21 01:30 AM] kingofcats#9205

[09-Aug-21 01:37 AM] kingofcats#9205

[09-Aug-21 01:41 AM] kingofcats#9205
honestly i can really scare people


[09-Aug-21 01:41 AM] kingofcats#9205
but for the wrong reasons


[09-Aug-21 01:41 AM] kingofcats#9205
i can keep my face expressionless for a really long period of time


[09-Aug-21 01:41 AM] kingofcats#9205
i think i creeped out a teacher with that


[09-Aug-21 01:42 AM] kingofcats#9205
i usually fall under that category


[09-Aug-21 01:42 AM] kingofcats#9205
but there have been times i actually scared people


[09-Aug-21 01:42 AM] kingofcats#9205
ahahahahah


[09-Aug-21 01:42 AM] kingofcats#9205
i am a huge crybaby too


[09-Aug-21 01:42 AM] kingofcats#9205
when i'm getting confused or flustered or trying to make a point


[09-Aug-21 01:42 AM] kingofcats#9205
i just end up crying


[09-Aug-21 01:43 AM] kingofcats#9205
idk there's my cute angry


[09-Aug-21 01:43 AM] kingofcats#9205
and then there's my seething, actually terrifying angry


[09-Aug-21 01:43 AM] kingofcats#9205
usually i fall in the cute angry where people don't take me seriously


[09-Aug-21 01:43 AM] kingofcats#9205
oh i just have no expression when i talk to authority figures


[09-Aug-21 01:43 AM] kingofcats#9205
my facial muscles just kinda die


[09-Aug-21 01:44 AM] kingofcats#9205
hate this


[09-Aug-21 01:44 AM] kingofcats#9205
when my facial muscles are dead people are always like "i can't read you" but i also don't care enough to actually idk express myself


[09-Aug-21 01:44 AM] kingofcats#9205
rightttttttttttt


[09-Aug-21 01:44 AM] kingofcats#9205
and then i'm like okay i'll just be petty


[09-Aug-21 01:45 AM] kingofcats#9205
but i also don't have enough energy or ability to be petty enough


[09-Aug-21 01:45 AM] kingofcats#9205
i felt that


[09-Aug-21 01:45 AM] kingofcats#9205
i didn't glare but i had no expressions because idk that's how i hung out with toxic people


[09-Aug-21 01:46 AM] kingofcats#9205
i wanted to be petty with my mom's high school classmate but don't have the energy to


[09-Aug-21 01:46 AM] kingofcats#9205
well she approached me


[09-Aug-21 01:46 AM] kingofcats#9205
told me i "looked lonely" and told me dw her daughter will keep me company next time


[09-Aug-21 01:47 AM] kingofcats#9205
and i almost lost my self control


[09-Aug-21 01:47 AM] kingofcats#9205
i just kinda wanted to cuss her out but like idk


[09-Aug-21 01:47 AM] kingofcats#9205
well it was all boys


[09-Aug-21 01:47 AM] kingofcats#9205
see my mom's hs best friend has 2 sons


[09-Aug-21 01:47 AM] kingofcats#9205
that other woman had a son there


[09-Aug-21 01:47 AM] kingofcats#9205
and i have my brother


[09-Aug-21 01:47 AM] kingofcats#9205
so i was the only girl


[09-Aug-21 01:47 AM] kingofcats#9205
but that lady's daughter is a literal child & i'm an adult


[09-Aug-21 01:48 AM] kingofcats#9205
plus i've hung out with the other 2 boys plenty of times???


[09-Aug-21 01:48 AM] kingofcats#9205
i know right


[09-Aug-21 01:49 AM] kingofcats#9205
i was gonna swear but her kid is 12


[09-Aug-21 01:49 AM] kingofcats#9205
pushy?


[09-Aug-21 01:50 AM] kingofcats#9205
just her son


[09-Aug-21 01:50 AM] kingofcats#9205

[09-Aug-21 01:50 AM] kingofcats#9205
so like reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee


[09-Aug-21 01:50 AM] kingofcats#9205
idk what it is with some asian moms and boundaries


[09-Aug-21 01:51 AM] kingofcats#9205
i know which is why i was going to be petty and not respect her since she didn't respect me as an 18 year old


[09-Aug-21 01:51 AM] kingofcats#9205
idk i don't really want to hang out with her children lmfao


[09-Aug-21 01:51 AM] kingofcats#9205

[09-Aug-21 01:08 PM] kingofcats#9205
AH ZOEEEE THAT"S SO CUTE TOO


[09-Aug-21 01:08 PM] kingofcats#9205
whenever i see cats or dogs i just feel really happy


[09-Aug-21 01:09 PM] kingofcats#9205
i think it's kinda like the whole thing with bulldogs and it being hard to breathe


[09-Aug-21 01:10 PM] kingofcats#9205
i remember people also said that munchkin cats with super stubby legs are concerning too


[09-Aug-21 01:10 PM] kingofcats#9205
most purebred cats have issues cause well,,, inbreeding


[09-Aug-21 01:12 PM] kingofcats#9205
honestly i like mixed breeds more for that very reason


[09-Aug-21 01:13 PM] kingofcats#9205
plus they're actually v v v cute


[09-Aug-21 01:14 PM] kingofcats#9205
omg that is really not cute


[09-Aug-21 01:14 PM] kingofcats#9205

[09-Aug-21 01:16 PM] kingofcats#9205
i mean i did calc ab ;w;


[09-Aug-21 01:17 PM] kingofcats#9205
i skipped precalc trig at my school b/c i could


[09-Aug-21 01:18 PM] kingofcats#9205
our school had this weird setup where if we took a specific math class we could skip that part so i did


[09-Aug-21 01:18 PM] kingofcats#9205
and i took precalc trig concurrent and remembered nothing


[09-Aug-21 01:18 PM] kingofcats#9205
but calc a went just fine


[09-Aug-21 01:19 PM] kingofcats#9205
oh we were on the integrated math system so it went something like
integrated 1 > integrated 2> integrated 3/3STEM (if you did 3 stem you could skip)> integrated 4


[09-Aug-21 02:32 PM] kingofcats#9205
i feel like doing ab bc in a year is nice since you'd only need 1 ap test, the bc one


[09-Aug-21 05:52 PM] kingofcats#9205

[10-Aug-21 04:43 PM] kingofcats#9205
i really like medical shows, i think it started from when i was a kid


[10-Aug-21 04:43 PM] kingofcats#9205
my grandma had no idea what i was watching, but i ended up this old medical examiner show on discovery that was actually not my age... i think that't when it started lmfao

[10-Aug-21 04:47 PM] kingofcats#9205
yeah i think the show's name is from the textbook
my human anatomy prof recommended it as a supplementary read though i never read it


[10-Aug-21 04:47 PM] kingofcats#9205
there are 162 songs, i don't really wanna scroll :3


[10-Aug-21 04:47 PM] kingofcats#9205
i think the first time i heard lauv was when he did a song with troye sivan


[10-Aug-21 04:49 PM] kingofcats#9205
i had my troye sivan phase in 8th grade or something


[10-Aug-21 04:49 PM] kingofcats#9205

[10-Aug-21 04:53 PM] kingofcats#9205

[10-Aug-21 04:53 PM] kingofcats#9205
i never hung up the posters and i'm not about to take them with me to college aaaaaa idk what i was thinking

[10-Aug-21 04:54 PM] kingofcats#9205
don't think so?


[10-Aug-21 04:54 PM] kingofcats#9205
i mean i've always loved ghibli and i watched it ages upon ages ago


[10-Aug-21 04:55 PM] kingofcats#9205
plus i got into haikyuu in 8th grade lmfao


[10-Aug-21 04:55 PM] kingofcats#9205

[10-Aug-21 04:55 PM] kingofcats#9205
y e s


[10-Aug-21 04:55 PM] kingofcats#9205
i think so?


[10-Aug-21 04:56 PM] kingofcats#9205
aw shucks i thought my new favorite animated movie in japanese was by ghibli & it's not


[10-Aug-21 04:57 PM] kingofcats#9205
the boy and the beast


[10-Aug-21 04:57 PM] kingofcats#9205
i thought of a really random question


[10-Aug-21 04:57 PM] kingofcats#9205
do you remember which disney princess you wanted to be when you were a kid?


[10-Aug-21 04:58 PM] kingofcats#9205
omg belle!!! that's a good one :3


[10-Aug-21 04:58 PM] kingofcats#9205
mine was snow white i think


[10-Aug-21 04:59 PM] kingofcats#9205
yeah it's really old now that i think of it


[10-Aug-21 04:59 PM] kingofcats#9205
fr they areeeeeeeee


[10-Aug-21 04:59 PM] kingofcats#9205
oml that's my gripe with so many storiessssssss


[10-Aug-21 05:00 PM] kingofcats#9205
like now that i'm older and life happened, you end up being like why did they just magically get better and how?


[10-Aug-21 05:00 PM] kingofcats#9205
not just sad but also morbid af


[10-Aug-21 05:01 PM] kingofcats#9205
disney censorship


[10-Aug-21 05:01 PM] kingofcats#9205
if i remember right, the original grimm's brother tale the mermaid dies and becomes seafoam


[10-Aug-21 05:01 PM] kingofcats#9205
it's the premise ponyo is set around


[10-Aug-21 05:01 PM] kingofcats#9205
not the whole dying thing though


[10-Aug-21 05:02 PM] kingofcats#9205
it was really a dead dove: do not eat


[10-Aug-21 05:03 PM] kingofcats#9205
wait which one?


[10-Aug-21 05:03 PM] kingofcats#9205
dead dove: do not eat is a tag people use for fanfiction and works that are pretty much as labeled to warn readers that all the tags on the work are indeed as dark as the author has indicated


[10-Aug-21 05:04 PM] kingofcats#9205
it's kind of a read at your discretion tag


[10-Aug-21 05:04 PM] kingofcats#9205
it was taken from a tv show i think


[10-Aug-21 05:04 PM] kingofcats#9205
lmaoo i know really useless things ahahah


[10-Aug-21 05:05 PM] kingofcats#9205
sometimes it makes you wonder though


[10-Aug-21 05:05 PM] kingofcats#9205
like the chemical hazards signs, does everyone actually know how to read that stuff?


[10-Aug-21 05:05 PM] kingofcats#9205
i mean  i had to for school


[10-Aug-21 05:06 PM] kingofcats#9205
yeah! the signs just specify what kind of dangers i think


[10-Aug-21 05:07 PM] kingofcats#9205
i forget all the dangers but i know i got tested on them for whatever reason


[10-Aug-21 05:07 PM] kingofcats#9205
i think the point is, be careful


[10-Aug-21 05:08 PM] kingofcats#9205
did you all also have to do those lab safety tests?


[10-Aug-21 05:08 PM] kingofcats#9205
well it might have been just my teacher since he was a retired industrial chemist or smth


[10-Aug-21 05:08 PM] kingofcats#9205
well it might have been just my teacher since he was a retired industrial chemist or smth


[10-Aug-21 05:09 PM] kingofcats#9205
yeah!!! that stuff and the rules for being in a lab


[10-Aug-21 05:09 PM] kingofcats#9205
ngl i failed mine once


[10-Aug-21 05:10 PM] kingofcats#9205
yeah apparently sometimes my common sense goes to sleep


[10-Aug-21 05:10 PM] kingofcats#9205
fr fr


[10-Aug-21 05:10 PM] kingofcats#9205
oh i failed that the first time too ahahah


[10-Aug-21 05:11 PM] kingofcats#9205
i passed the second time


[10-Aug-21 05:11 PM] kingofcats#9205
but i think it was only because my parents kept drilling it into my brain ngl


[10-Aug-21 05:11 PM] kingofcats#9205
like we were in sf and my dad was grilling me on parallel parking on a hillside


[10-Aug-21 05:12 PM] kingofcats#9205
yeah!! those


[10-Aug-21 05:12 PM] kingofcats#9205
and then my brother kept laughing at me for forgetting the difference between high beam and low beam


[10-Aug-21 05:14 PM] kingofcats#9205
lmfao


[10-Aug-21 05:14 PM] kingofcats#9205
same though


[10-Aug-21 05:15 PM] kingofcats#9205
okay now a really random question


[10-Aug-21 05:15 PM] kingofcats#9205

[10-Aug-21 05:17 PM] kingofcats#9205

[10-Aug-21 05:32 PM] kingofcats#9205
that's just kinda become my opener ahahah


[10-Aug-21 05:32 PM] kingofcats#9205

[10-Aug-21 05:34 PM] kingofcats#9205
oh yeah the slash commands


[10-Aug-21 05:34 PM] kingofcats#9205
a lot of the discord bots are migrating over to slash commands as well


[10-Aug-21 05:34 PM] kingofcats#9205

[10-Aug-21 06:16 PM] kingofcats#9205
i remember learning to ski, snowboard, and ice skate


[10-Aug-21 06:17 PM] kingofcats#9205
yeah i started with ice skating and fell on my butt so often that i quit


[10-Aug-21 06:17 PM] kingofcats#9205
sameeee


[10-Aug-21 06:17 PM] kingofcats#9205
i just ended up tumbling and falling on my butt ahahah


[10-Aug-21 06:17 PM] kingofcats#9205
see i did snowboarding cause i thought skiing was too hard


[10-Aug-21 06:17 PM] kingofcats#9205
as it turns out, skiing was easier on my butt ahahahahahah


[10-Aug-21 06:19 PM] kingofcats#9205
i swear it's so easy to fall over in skii boots because they really lock your ankles in ahahah


[10-Aug-21 06:21 PM] kingofcats#9205
skii boots are really unforgiving smh


[10-Aug-21 06:21 PM] kingofcats#9205
the snowboarding boots are much nicer


[10-Aug-21 06:21 PM] kingofcats#9205
once i skiied into a hula hoop and i got a giant bruise from my skii boot


[10-Aug-21 06:22 PM] kingofcats#9205
i mean i was moving kinda fast, but it was like my whole shin


[10-Aug-21 06:22 PM] kingofcats#9205
it wasn't though


[10-Aug-21 06:22 PM] kingofcats#9205
i don't get how i got a bruise when all that happened was a light thump sound


[10-Aug-21 06:24 PM] kingofcats#9205
trueeee


[10-Aug-21 06:24 PM] kingofcats#9205
what kind of hobbies do y'all have


[10-Aug-21 06:26 PM] kingofcats#9205
i mean i write a lot, read a lot, learn a lot of random facts to fill the silence :3, talk way too much which is a more recent development, watch streams, and otherwise fill my time with something


[10-Aug-21 06:26 PM] kingofcats#9205
omg stringed instruments are harddddddd


[10-Aug-21 06:27 PM] kingofcats#9205
i've done guitar and violin and it's hard


[10-Aug-21 06:27 PM] kingofcats#9205
i joined a server with an activity req and went crazy within three days


[10-Aug-21 06:28 PM] kingofcats#9205
i'm like ranked 8th even though it's been less than a month, granted it's a small-ish server


[10-Aug-21 06:29 PM] kingofcats#9205
i'm not v active in the c'o 2025 one lmao


[10-Aug-21 06:30 PM] kingofcats#9205
me?


[10-Aug-21 06:30 PM] kingofcats#9205
gimme a sec i gotta count


[10-Aug-21 06:31 PM] kingofcats#9205
36 if we count this one


[10-Aug-21 06:31 PM] kingofcats#9205
but if we subtract the two i've been using to play with bots that i own, then 34


[10-Aug-21 06:31 PM] kingofcats#9205
although i might have miscounted ngl


[10-Aug-21 06:32 PM] kingofcats#9205
but i think it's accurate


[10-Aug-21 06:32 PM] kingofcats#9205
i mean, that could be a good thing


[10-Aug-21 06:32 PM] kingofcats#9205
i have to stay on do not disturb because otherwise my discord notifs would be going off a lot


[10-Aug-21 06:33 PM] kingofcats#9205
ahahah not really, a lot of the servers i'm in are big ones either for games or scans teams or just fandom servers


[10-Aug-21 06:33 PM] kingofcats#9205
and some of them are old and kinda dead


[10-Aug-21 06:33 PM] kingofcats#9205
i only really frequent this one and the guild server i have for a game where i have an activity req


[10-Aug-21 06:35 PM] kingofcats#9205
honestly it was so active during the first few weeks and then died
kinda like a lot of the group chats i joined


[10-Aug-21 06:36 PM] kingofcats#9205
probably my fault, i'm really chatty


[10-Aug-21 06:36 PM] kingofcats#9205
ahahahah


[10-Aug-21 06:36 PM] kingofcats#9205
i'm what you call  a chatty introvert


[10-Aug-21 06:37 PM] kingofcats#9205
but i just passed the point of no return a week ago so i might be more of an ambivert now


[10-Aug-21 06:37 PM] kingofcats#9205
lmfao


[10-Aug-21 06:37 PM] kingofcats#9205
about a week ago i joined a guild for a game with an activity requirement


[10-Aug-21 06:38 PM] kingofcats#9205
got panicked about the fact i'd have to talk and hit the requirement and then by the time i realized i was alright, i was already attached and had sent about a thousand messages


[10-Aug-21 06:38 PM] kingofcats#9205
i mean i type pretty fast and i also have had a lot of practice


[10-Aug-21 06:39 PM] kingofcats#9205
yes


[10-Aug-21 06:39 PM] kingofcats#9205
and i procrastinate on essays


[10-Aug-21 06:39 PM] kingofcats#9205
sooo


[10-Aug-21 06:39 PM] kingofcats#9205
yeah


[10-Aug-21 06:39 PM] kingofcats#9205
it's the only subject i can do minimal effort for


[10-Aug-21 06:40 PM] kingofcats#9205
i mean i do creative writing outside of school, but besides that i'm stuck proofreading whatever my family says i have to and doing schoolwork


[10-Aug-21 06:40 PM] kingofcats#9205
i don't understand how i write myself


[10-Aug-21 06:40 PM] kingofcats#9205
i just sit down and start writing what i'm thinking


[10-Aug-21 06:40 PM] kingofcats#9205
and then if it's for school, i jam in the quotes intermittently


[10-Aug-21 06:40 PM] kingofcats#9205
that's so cool!!!!


[10-Aug-21 06:41 PM] kingofcats#9205
oh that's super cool!


[10-Aug-21 06:41 PM] kingofcats#9205
omg senioritis was the reason i was averaging 3k words in my ao3


[10-Aug-21 06:41 PM] kingofcats#9205
my brain was like "why do the dracula essay when you could just write something entirely unrelated"


[10-Aug-21 06:42 PM] kingofcats#9205
i used to struggle but now it feels too short if i write less than a thousand words


[10-Aug-21 06:42 PM] kingofcats#9205
i get really bothered sometimes when i'm typing on discord and i hit the character limit but i'm not done with my thought


[10-Aug-21 06:43 PM] kingofcats#9205
lots of times


[10-Aug-21 06:43 PM] kingofcats#9205
i don't know


[10-Aug-21 06:43 PM] kingofcats#9205
oh i spammed my friend once , i gave them 100+ notifs in an hour


[10-Aug-21 06:43 PM] kingofcats#9205
i was in spanish with nothing to do


[10-Aug-21 06:44 PM] kingofcats#9205
nah my friend has their phone on silent mode lmfao


[10-Aug-21 06:45 PM] kingofcats#9205
i swear none of my friends feel lonely cause i'm so chatty smh


[10-Aug-21 06:45 PM] kingofcats#9205
yeah *now* that i think about it, it is


[10-Aug-21 06:47 PM] kingofcats#9205
okay same, but only when i don't know the other person really well and their reply habits


[10-Aug-21 06:47 PM] kingofcats#9205
the friend i gifted with 100+ notifs has a really bad habit of forgetting to respond so i just kinda just do whatever pleases me  ahahah


[10-Aug-21 06:48 PM] kingofcats#9205
lmaooo if you ever send me messages, promise i will reply lmfao


[10-Aug-21 06:48 PM] kingofcats#9205
i have wayyyy too much free time


[10-Aug-21 06:48 PM] kingofcats#9205
and even when i don't, i make it happen ahahahah


[10-Aug-21 06:49 PM] kingofcats#9205
honestly it just sits in my mind bugging me if i haven't replied


[10-Aug-21 06:49 PM] kingofcats#9205
so i try to get replies done before i entirely forget


[10-Aug-21 06:49 PM] kingofcats#9205
okay but my parents leave me on read all the time


[10-Aug-21 06:49 PM] kingofcats#9205
and so does my grandma


[10-Aug-21 06:50 PM] kingofcats#9205
i'll text my grandma happy birthday or something and for days there will be nothing and then maybe a week later, there's a read thing on line


[10-Aug-21 06:52 PM] kingofcats#9205
yeah and then she'll text me back much later in chinese even though she knows i can't read it


[10-Aug-21 06:52 PM] kingofcats#9205
so i have to run it through google translate so google reads it to me


[10-Aug-21 06:52 PM] kingofcats#9205
cause i can understand chinese but it's been years since i actually read chinese


[10-Aug-21 06:54 PM] kingofcats#9205
idk it really depends


[10-Aug-21 06:54 PM] kingofcats#9205
for one thing, if you have family who speak it, it's not that hard


[10-Aug-21 06:54 PM] kingofcats#9205
and if you speak and asian language, it might actually be easier


[10-Aug-21 06:55 PM] kingofcats#9205
like i don't really understand much japanese, but i've been watching a show and i can recognize some chinese characters and i've picked up a few phrases


[10-Aug-21 06:55 PM] kingofcats#9205
tv shows definitely help, though there are so many shows with different dialects and from different countries that speak chinese


[10-Aug-21 06:56 PM] kingofcats#9205
ahahahah it took me a while to recognize what the pinyin said lmfao


[10-Aug-21 06:57 PM] kingofcats#9205
honestly i just don't remember most of the characters i learned before i quit in 6th grade


[10-Aug-21 06:57 PM] kingofcats#9205
i used to go to tzu chi i think and omg it sucked


[10-Aug-21 06:57 PM] kingofcats#9205
i probably speak taiwanese hokkien better than i do chinese


[10-Aug-21 06:57 PM] kingofcats#9205
that stupid uniform


[10-Aug-21 06:58 PM] kingofcats#9205
and those nasty navy pants


[10-Aug-21 06:58 PM] kingofcats#9205
i remember how the teachers all wore literally the same thing


[10-Aug-21 06:58 PM] kingofcats#9205
and i used to cause so much troubleeee


[10-Aug-21 06:59 PM] kingofcats#9205
lmfaoooo


[10-Aug-21 06:59 PM] kingofcats#9205
honestly the only thing i learned was that the class was boring


[10-Aug-21 06:59 PM] kingofcats#9205
oh and the rewards they gave out sucked


[10-Aug-21 07:00 PM] kingofcats#9205
the only thing i can do is speak


[10-Aug-21 07:00 PM] kingofcats#9205
all my relatives speak full on chinese and when my mom yells at me, you bet she's screaming in chinese


[10-Aug-21 07:01 PM] kingofcats#9205
ahahahah ap chinese


[10-Aug-21 07:01 PM] kingofcats#9205
my brother's going to take that sometime


[10-Aug-21 07:01 PM] kingofcats#9205
i did spanish for my foreign language


[10-Aug-21 07:01 PM] kingofcats#9205
i thought it was easier cause i'm much better with my latin roots


[10-Aug-21 07:02 PM] kingofcats#9205
perhaps, but i messed up when i didn't take ap spanish :p


[10-Aug-21 07:03 PM] kingofcats#9205
i had to take the foreign lang placement but idk if i did okay 
my mom was like if you didn't do good, just take chinese and you'll be fine


[10-Aug-21 07:03 PM] kingofcats#9205
i mean it'll probably be quite easy but yeah, sucks


[10-Aug-21 07:03 PM] kingofcats#9205
i took 3 years of it to retake it potentially lmfao


[10-Aug-21 07:04 PM] kingofcats#9205
wait ethan, can you speak taiwanese?


[10-Aug-21 07:04 PM] kingofcats#9205
lmfaoooooo


[10-Aug-21 07:06 PM] kingofcats#9205
whatever i've learned is from my older relatives speaking in taiwanese to gossip b/c some of my family can't speak taiwanese 
although i've also had a relative speak full blown taiwanese at me and i understood almost nothing lmfao


[10-Aug-21 07:07 PM] kingofcats#9205
fr relatives are, they always think you understand more than you actually do


[10-Aug-21 07:08 PM] kingofcats#9205
hi again jenny!!!


[10-Aug-21 07:08 PM] kingofcats#9205
omg taiwanese is so hard to do pinyin for


[10-Aug-21 07:09 PM] kingofcats#9205
i think there are more intonations or smth for it


[10-Aug-21 07:09 PM] kingofcats#9205
i think the only perk of taiwanese is that other forms of hokkien are kinda similar to some degree


[10-Aug-21 07:09 PM] kingofcats#9205
well that and if half of your family isn't able to understand it, gossip


[10-Aug-21 07:10 PM] kingofcats#9205
ahahah my family mainly speaks taiwanese but my mom's brothers both married ppl who can't so their kids don't


[10-Aug-21 07:10 PM] kingofcats#9205
so my grandpa is always telling me to call him yeye idk if that pinyin is right


[10-Aug-21 07:10 PM] kingofcats#9205
even though i call him ah-gong which is taiwanese


[10-Aug-21 07:11 PM] kingofcats#9205
oof i picked it up cause i was the only kid when i was born


[10-Aug-21 07:11 PM] kingofcats#9205
my mom's side lived like in the area so they'd speak in taiwanese


[10-Aug-21 07:12 PM] kingofcats#9205
i only learned that when i started going to chinese school and i told my teacher i liked my ah-mah and she was like wHaT?


[10-Aug-21 07:13 PM] kingofcats#9205
omg i find it so frustrating when i have to explain who someone is relation to me in english


[10-Aug-21 07:13 PM] kingofcats#9205
like my grandma's sister is my grandaunt in chinese but in english she's just my aunt or something???


[10-Aug-21 07:13 PM] kingofcats#9205
it's really weird


[10-Aug-21 07:14 PM] kingofcats#9205
honestly don't know, apparently all the forms don't allow for that?


[10-Aug-21 07:14 PM] kingofcats#9205
right?


[10-Aug-21 07:15 PM] kingofcats#9205
oh wow


[10-Aug-21 07:15 PM] kingofcats#9205
ohhh that's kinda wild


[10-Aug-21 07:16 PM] kingofcats#9205
i don't know my cousins on my dad's side too well ngl


[10-Aug-21 07:16 PM] kingofcats#9205
not that i know any of my cousins too well lmfao


[10-Aug-21 07:16 PM] kingofcats#9205
lmaooo i guessed it was that :3


[10-Aug-21 07:16 PM] kingofcats#9205
and yeah!!! it's so hard to see family when they're in a diff country


[10-Aug-21 07:17 PM] kingofcats#9205
c ov id


[10-Aug-21 07:17 PM] kingofcats#9205
okay but did covid wreck anyone else's travel plan?


[10-Aug-21 07:17 PM] kingofcats#9205
omg new zealand!!! that's where the hobbit set is!!!!


[10-Aug-21 07:18 PM] kingofcats#9205
lmaooo they made that set in like the 2000s


[10-Aug-21 07:19 PM] kingofcats#9205
that's actually pretty cool!!


[10-Aug-21 07:19 PM] kingofcats#9205
i think my parents let me watch lord of the rings


[10-Aug-21 07:20 PM] kingofcats#9205
i got hooked, read the books, and then ended up watching the hobbit trilogy when it came out


[10-Aug-21 07:20 PM] kingofcats#9205
honestly the battle of five armies makes people cry


[10-Aug-21 07:21 PM] kingofcats#9205
so there's a warning :3


[10-Aug-21 07:21 PM] kingofcats#9205
honestly i remember crying over raya


[10-Aug-21 07:22 PM] kingofcats#9205
ahahah


[10-Aug-21 07:22 PM] kingofcats#9205
did you ever read eragon?


[10-Aug-21 07:22 PM] kingofcats#9205
yeah it was one of the newer ones!!!


[10-Aug-21 07:23 PM] kingofcats#9205
oh that's actually really fair


[10-Aug-21 07:23 PM] kingofcats#9205
the series is *long*


[10-Aug-21 07:23 PM] kingofcats#9205
in terms of page count


[10-Aug-21 07:23 PM] kingofcats#9205
the movie was different from the book, idr by how much


[10-Aug-21 07:24 PM] kingofcats#9205
okay this begs a very important question (i really hope other people answer too) 
what's a movie that made you cry?


[10-Aug-21 07:24 PM] kingofcats#9205
artemis fowl will make you question what the heck disney is doing
the book and the movie are two different things entirely that only share one thing in common: the names of the characters


[10-Aug-21 07:26 PM] kingofcats#9205
y es


[10-Aug-21 07:26 PM] kingofcats#9205
i don't think i ever watched it


[10-Aug-21 07:26 PM] kingofcats#9205
but definitely, if it's good, say so


[10-Aug-21 07:26 PM] kingofcats#9205
are most people only here for open lab hours?


[10-Aug-21 07:26 PM] kingofcats#9205
is that why it's just you & me in chat?


[10-Aug-21 07:27 PM] kingofcats#9205
maybe we should temp move to dms until someone else joins lmfao


[10-Aug-21 07:28 PM] kingofcats#9205
y e s


[10-Aug-21 07:39 PM] kingofcats#9205
hi  again alexxxxxxx!!!


[10-Aug-21 07:39 PM] kingofcats#9205
omg endgame made me so sad too!!!


[10-Aug-21 07:40 PM] kingofcats#9205
ahhh that movie was a difficult one to watchhh


[10-Aug-21 07:41 PM] kingofcats#9205
honestly i just c r y


[10-Aug-21 07:41 PM] kingofcats#9205
jenny, i felt the whole wanting to watch the whole series


[10-Aug-21 07:41 PM] kingofcats#9205
but my dad and brother kinda watched it without me  so i just kinda joined at random


[10-Aug-21 07:42 PM] kingofcats#9205
the only marvel series i watched was the harley quinn stuff


[10-Aug-21 07:42 PM] kingofcats#9205
idk i think marvel produced 2 harley films?


[10-Aug-21 07:42 PM] kingofcats#9205
cause the new one that just came out is a dc film


[10-Aug-21 07:43 PM] kingofcats#9205
yeah idk what was going on with that


[10-Aug-21 07:43 PM] kingofcats#9205
cause some people i knew were chatting about the new suicide squad and saying it was funny that dc took the marvel director and marvel harley lmfao


[10-Aug-21 07:44 PM] kingofcats#9205
honestly i don't remember


[10-Aug-21 07:44 PM] kingofcats#9205
yeah i think the new one is in theatres


[10-Aug-21 07:44 PM] kingofcats#9205
don't mind me and my weird spelling idk what happens but sometimes i switch between american spelling and british or something


[10-Aug-21 07:44 PM] kingofcats#9205
lmaooooo


[10-Aug-21 07:45 PM] kingofcats#9205
flavour and flavor


[10-Aug-21 07:45 PM] kingofcats#9205
neighbourhood and neighborhood


[10-Aug-21 07:45 PM] kingofcats#9205
the u sneaks in so often because i think during my troye phase he spelled neighbourhood with the u


[10-Aug-21 07:46 PM] kingofcats#9205
honestly i just kinda go with my gut for spelling but i've also had plenty of correctly spelled words that i thought i misspelled


[10-Aug-21 07:47 PM] kingofcats#9205
lmaooo


[10-Aug-21 07:47 PM] kingofcats#9205
also not me having two different characters with one as my lock and one as my home screen


[10-Aug-21 07:47 PM] kingofcats#9205
i swear piece trips me up so much


[10-Aug-21 07:48 PM] kingofcats#9205
omg i type to fast and sometimes my keyboard can't keep up


[10-Aug-21 07:48 PM] kingofcats#9205
awwwwwwwww that's so cuteeeee


[10-Aug-21 07:48 PM] kingofcats#9205
autocorrect does me so dirty sometimes that i just turn it off and type whatever the heck i want


[10-Aug-21 07:49 PM] kingofcats#9205
it'll autocorrect all the romaji i type and it just kinda goes downhill from there


[10-Aug-21 07:49 PM] kingofcats#9205
also do you all have that weird thing where your phone recs you german or some european language despite your keyboard and your phone being in english?


[10-Aug-21 07:50 PM] kingofcats#9205
my phone and ads think i'm google translate or something


[10-Aug-21 07:50 PM] kingofcats#9205
my phone is like you must speak some random european language that you don't


[10-Aug-21 07:50 PM] kingofcats#9205
and then i keep getting men's ads and ads in spanish


[10-Aug-21 07:51 PM] kingofcats#9205
pretty much i just sit there barely comprehending what's going on


[10-Aug-21 07:51 PM] kingofcats#9205
ahahah my phone recommends me two of my games


[10-Aug-21 07:51 PM] kingofcats#9205
marketing really missed the target with me lmfao


[10-Aug-21 07:52 PM] kingofcats#9205
i will say youtube screwed up theirs


[10-Aug-21 07:52 PM] kingofcats#9205
i keep getting recommended stuff that i have never seen before


[10-Aug-21 07:52 PM] kingofcats#9205
and their ads are all off


[10-Aug-21 07:52 PM] kingofcats#9205
i can't count how many times i've gotten the same old spice ad


[10-Aug-21 07:52 PM] kingofcats#9205
lmaooo i've never seen that


[10-Aug-21 07:53 PM] kingofcats#9205
when i run out of posts from friends i just get cat pics


[10-Aug-21 07:53 PM] kingofcats#9205
omg i want to disable snap's reels and stories


[10-Aug-21 07:53 PM] kingofcats#9205
their recs for stories are just kinda weird and really clickbait-y


[10-Aug-21 07:53 PM] kingofcats#9205
and a number of them are gross


[10-Aug-21 07:54 PM] kingofcats#9205
i just dislike seeing the recommendations cause they have no taste


[10-Aug-21 07:54 PM] kingofcats#9205
like at least instagram knows what i like lmfao


[10-Aug-21 07:57 PM] kingofcats#9205
honestly i just have old ones


[10-Aug-21 07:57 PM] kingofcats#9205
and wait


[10-Aug-21 07:57 PM] kingofcats#9205
insta knows me too well


[10-Aug-21 07:57 PM] kingofcats#9205
they recommended a reel of a cat crossing a basketball court


[10-Aug-21 07:58 PM] kingofcats#9205

[10-Aug-21 07:58 PM] kingofcats#9205

it would be great


[10-Aug-21 08:13 PM] kingofcats#9205
i remember doing this two summers ago, it was harddd


[10-Aug-21 08:13 PM] kingofcats#9205
i had this writing thing and my mentor/teacher? would say the funniest and weirdest things so we tried to track it but it got hard after a few weeks


[10-Aug-21 08:14 PM] kingofcats#9205
we kept it on a doc


[10-Aug-21 08:14 PM] kingofcats#9205
but it was def hard to keep track of after a certain point


[10-Aug-21 08:15 PM] kingofcats#9205
i found one of the things he said actually lmfao


[10-Aug-21 08:17 PM] kingofcats#9205

ethannnnnn please explainnnnnn


[10-Aug-21 08:19 PM] kingofcats#9205
on a less related note once the guy said ‚Äúi don‚Äôt know all the rules of your residential prison‚Äù


[10-Aug-21 08:20 PM] kingofcats#9205
honestly looking at the doc where we kept the quotes we wrote for him brings back memories


[10-Aug-21 08:21 PM] kingofcats#9205
that‚Äôs why we should do one for spis :3


[10-Aug-21 08:21 PM] kingofcats#9205
just random quotes with no context


[10-Aug-21 08:22 PM] kingofcats#9205

[10-Aug-21 08:23 PM] kingofcats#9205
that would probably give you great poems though


[10-Aug-21 08:28 PM] kingofcats#9205
sounds good

my brain just randomly went ‚Äúcards against humanity‚Äù


[11-Aug-21 12:02 AM] kingofcats#9205
idk what it means but i played it once and it was interesting


[11-Aug-21 12:05 AM] kingofcats#9205
oml i just realized my brother starts school today ahahahahah


[11-Aug-21 12:09 AM] kingofcats#9205
i was so caught off guard b/c i didn't know what the cards were like


[11-Aug-21 12:10 AM] kingofcats#9205
i mean it's high school?


[11-Aug-21 12:10 AM] kingofcats#9205
yeah that made for an interesting few rounds where i was thoroughly confused


[11-Aug-21 12:10 AM] kingofcats#9205
i didn't know the game was like apples to apples but adult ahahah


[11-Aug-21 12:11 AM] kingofcats#9205
it was an experience to say the least


[11-Aug-21 12:15 AM] kingofcats#9205
totally random but i swear so many people play genshin


[11-Aug-21 12:16 AM] kingofcats#9205

[11-Aug-21 12:19 AM] kingofcats#9205

[11-Aug-21 12:20 AM] kingofcats#9205
i stuck to fgo after that


[11-Aug-21 12:21 AM] kingofcats#9205
some girl i knew wanted me to cosplay a character from it


[11-Aug-21 12:21 AM] kingofcats#9205
so i thought i'd check it out but yeah game was too hard :3


[11-Aug-21 12:22 AM] kingofcats#9205
lemme look in my chats with a diff friend i think i found the name


[11-Aug-21 12:22 AM] kingofcats#9205
but she has like pastel purple hair


[11-Aug-21 12:23 AM] kingofcats#9205
yeah! her


[11-Aug-21 12:24 AM] kingofcats#9205
idk why her of all characters


[11-Aug-21 12:28 AM] kingofcats#9205
ohhhh


[11-Aug-21 12:28 AM] kingofcats#9205
well i'm still not gonna do it lmao


[11-Aug-21 12:28 AM] kingofcats#9205
i've had the experience of wearing fake ears


[11-Aug-21 12:28 AM] kingofcats#9205
they weren't cat ears, but fox ears


[11-Aug-21 12:28 AM] kingofcats#9205
and i also had a tail to match lmfao


[11-Aug-21 12:29 AM] kingofcats#9205
is she just stabbing the slime?


[11-Aug-21 12:29 AM] kingofcats#9205
wow


[11-Aug-21 12:29 AM] kingofcats#9205
nothing it's been my halloween costume many times


[11-Aug-21 12:29 AM] kingofcats#9205
it was once my brother's costume for his what does the fox say that practically all the kids his age did back when the song was big


[11-Aug-21 12:30 AM] kingofcats#9205
once i passed it off as a kitsune costume


[11-Aug-21 12:30 AM] kingofcats#9205
the rest of the time it was just a low effort costume for fun


[11-Aug-21 12:32 AM] kingofcats#9205
i don't know her as a character + no clue what her voice lines are


[11-Aug-21 12:32 AM] kingofcats#9205
it would be awkward if someone saw me and she was their fave character


[11-Aug-21 12:36 AM] kingofcats#9205
oh and then i'd get worried that someone would ask me about the game ahahah


[11-Aug-21 12:37 AM] kingofcats#9205
@Viridion ^ :3


[11-Aug-21 12:40 AM] kingofcats#9205
so i've heardddd


[11-Aug-21 12:41 AM] kingofcats#9205
do you have a favorite character?


[11-Aug-21 12:41 AM] kingofcats#9205
i find paimon absolutely irritating


[11-Aug-21 12:44 AM] kingofcats#9205
oh wow he looks cool


[11-Aug-21 12:47 AM] kingofcats#9205
ohhhh that's interesting


[11-Aug-21 12:47 AM] kingofcats#9205
i feel like he's one of those popular characters who has a bunch of fanfics


[11-Aug-21 12:47 AM] kingofcats#9205
i know kaeya's also popular


[11-Aug-21 12:47 AM] kingofcats#9205
ohhhh that's v true


[11-Aug-21 12:48 AM] kingofcats#9205
i have some friends who like to whale on games


[11-Aug-21 12:48 AM] kingofcats#9205
wow lmao


[11-Aug-21 12:48 AM] kingofcats#9205
ngl i thought kaeya was a girl for a while


[11-Aug-21 12:49 AM] kingofcats#9205
lmfao


[11-Aug-21 12:49 AM] kingofcats#9205
kaeya seemed like one of those noveau ways of spelling kaya


[11-Aug-21 12:49 AM] kingofcats#9205
i thought maybe he was just flat???


[11-Aug-21 12:51 AM] kingofcats#9205
okay :3


[11-Aug-21 12:57 AM] kingofcats#9205
hmmm should i do an appearance change and wear glasses tomorrow?


[11-Aug-21 01:08 AM] kingofcats#9205
lmaooo guess i will then


[11-Aug-21 01:08 AM] kingofcats#9205
i have a nice frame so it'll be fun


[11-Aug-21 01:08 AM] kingofcats#9205
ahahah it can be one of those spot the difference games lmfao


[11-Aug-21 01:09 AM] kingofcats#9205
unrelated but riot games really has life figured out


[11-Aug-21 01:10 AM] kingofcats#9205
they started doing music and apparently now they're doing a show too?


[11-Aug-21 01:10 AM] kingofcats#9205
meanwhile blizzard wow animatics are so nice


[11-Aug-21 01:11 AM] kingofcats#9205
but they don't turn them into like actual movies


[11-Aug-21 01:11 AM] kingofcats#9205
my 1 am complaints are weird as heck


[11-Aug-21 01:11 AM] kingofcats#9205
yeah apparently


[11-Aug-21 01:11 AM] kingofcats#9205
but ngl cgi is not their strong suit imo


[11-Aug-21 01:11 AM] kingofcats#9205
it's actually their trailers for the games that rock


[11-Aug-21 01:12 AM] kingofcats#9205
like the shadowlands patch for wow had some seriously great art and storytelling and voice acting


[11-Aug-21 01:12 AM] kingofcats#9205
i think the game with the best cgi trailer i've seen would be the one made for diablo 4


[11-Aug-21 01:12 AM] kingofcats#9205
i don't play either game


[11-Aug-21 01:13 AM] kingofcats#9205
i ended up getting into the rabbithole of wow lore after i accidentally came across one of the videos


[11-Aug-21 01:13 AM] kingofcats#9205
my dad played wow ages ago and he still plays diablo


[11-Aug-21 01:13 AM] kingofcats#9205
oml league


[11-Aug-21 01:14 AM] kingofcats#9205
i think i only got interested b/c of k/da + the lead singer for this band that i liked did a song with them


[11-Aug-21 01:14 AM] kingofcats#9205
and then someone showed me that they somehow made a holographic dragon appear in a stadium which i thought was cool


[11-Aug-21 01:14 AM] kingofcats#9205
but i had an ex who played league


[11-Aug-21 01:15 AM] kingofcats#9205
ahahahahahah


[11-Aug-21 01:15 AM] kingofcats#9205
what makes that a red flag?


[11-Aug-21 01:15 AM] kingofcats#9205
oml lmfao


[11-Aug-21 01:15 AM] kingofcats#9205
my brother did and he complained about it


[11-Aug-21 01:16 AM] kingofcats#9205
i don't remember what his complaint was


[11-Aug-21 01:16 AM] kingofcats#9205
wait then why do they still play?


[11-Aug-21 01:16 AM] kingofcats#9205
okay but i kinda understand that sentiment


[11-Aug-21 01:17 AM] kingofcats#9205
sometimes i really hate the games i play because i have to do so many events in a month


[11-Aug-21 01:17 AM] kingofcats#9205
i guess it takes a real league player to explain how one can hate a game and still play it lmfao


[11-Aug-21 01:18 AM] kingofcats#9205
lmaoooo i should do that


[11-Aug-21 01:18 AM] kingofcats#9205
but it's hard to not play them ahsfklhsaf


[11-Aug-21 01:19 AM] kingofcats#9205
ohhhhhhh


[11-Aug-21 01:19 AM] kingofcats#9205
that makes sense


[11-Aug-21 01:20 AM] kingofcats#9205
that just described animal crossing pocket camp


[11-Aug-21 01:20 AM] kingofcats#9205
every month there's a new event with three parts


[11-Aug-21 01:20 AM] kingofcats#9205
and every month i play it even though it's like a job


[11-Aug-21 01:20 AM] kingofcats#9205
i tell myself i don't need every single stupid pixel furniture


[11-Aug-21 01:20 AM] kingofcats#9205
but then i come up with another reason to play


[11-Aug-21 01:21 AM] kingofcats#9205
although a lot of my old friends stopped playing :3


[11-Aug-21 01:22 AM] kingofcats#9205
ohhh well all my friends were mainly adults who had lives outside of the game lmao


[11-Aug-21 01:23 AM] kingofcats#9205
lmfao yep


[11-Aug-21 01:25 AM] kingofcats#9205
i honestly ask myself why i still stay up late sometimes


[11-Aug-21 01:26 AM] kingofcats#9205
lmfao


[11-Aug-21 01:27 AM] kingofcats#9205
out of curiosity, how is it that you never sleep much?


[11-Aug-21 01:28 AM] kingofcats#9205
that's fair


[11-Aug-21 01:30 AM] kingofcats#9205
oml sameeee


[11-Aug-21 01:32 AM] kingofcats#9205
i-
i couldn't do that i'm already tired from 7 hours


[11-Aug-21 01:34 AM] kingofcats#9205
that's scary


[11-Aug-21 02:48 PM] kingofcats#9205
honestly sometimes i use brute force to fix my sleep schedule


[11-Aug-21 02:58 PM] kingofcats#9205
as alex h said, melatonin


[11-Aug-21 02:58 PM] kingofcats#9205
it works but if you overtake them they won't


[11-Aug-21 02:58 PM] kingofcats#9205
and then you'll have to hunt for the stronger alternative that i think is much harder to find


[11-Aug-21 02:59 PM] kingofcats#9205
i have never taken more than 1 ngl


[11-Aug-21 02:59 PM] kingofcats#9205
but i know an insomniac who kept upping their dosage and now the melatonin does nothing


[11-Aug-21 03:00 PM] kingofcats#9205
honestly i think the only other brute force method is to make yourself tired by aggressively messing up your sleep schedule


[11-Aug-21 03:00 PM] kingofcats#9205
i did that once and actually went to bed on time for the first time


[11-Aug-21 03:43 PM] kingofcats#9205
lmaoooooo zoe


[11-Aug-21 03:44 PM] kingofcats#9205
for whatever reason it feels like everyone and everything is so tall lmao


[11-Aug-21 04:10 PM] kingofcats#9205
ohhhh wow


[11-Aug-21 05:01 PM] kingofcats#9205
@Cinnamon Bun i forgot to ask this last night, what are we naming the giraffe?


[11-Aug-21 05:03 PM] kingofcats#9205
w h y


[11-Aug-21 05:04 PM] kingofcats#9205

[11-Aug-21 05:05 PM] kingofcats#9205
lmfao


[11-Aug-21 05:05 PM] kingofcats#9205

[11-Aug-21 05:08 PM] kingofcats#9205
as my high school art teacher said, "a for effort"

{Reactions}

[11-Aug-21 07:28 PM] kingofcats#9205

[11-Aug-21 07:28 PM] kingofcats#9205
i might just be really sleep deprived and confused then


[11-Aug-21 07:29 PM] kingofcats#9205

but i've been wearing nighttime contacts for a long time


[11-Aug-21 07:33 PM] kingofcats#9205
so usually i can see fine without glasses, i just skipped wearing them last night so i got to wear my glasses


[11-Aug-21 07:33 PM] kingofcats#9205
ohhhhhh


[11-Aug-21 07:33 PM] kingofcats#9205
my dad can't wear them either


[11-Aug-21 07:33 PM] kingofcats#9205
i don't mind wearing my glasses though, i picked a nice frame this time lmao


[11-Aug-21 07:34 PM] kingofcats#9205
they really are


[11-Aug-21 07:34 PM] kingofcats#9205
lmaooo yes


[11-Aug-21 07:34 PM] kingofcats#9205
how limited the amount of food i can eat is?


[11-Aug-21 07:35 PM] kingofcats#9205
i don't have actual restrictions on what i eat, just self imposed stuff


[11-Aug-21 07:35 PM] kingofcats#9205
oh for example, i don't like bell peppers because they have this smell that i hate


[11-Aug-21 07:35 PM] kingofcats#9205
and then i don't like most smoothies because my mom has made really thick smoothies and i don't trust smoothies that aren't pink or purple-y


[11-Aug-21 07:36 PM] kingofcats#9205
yeah i don't like bell peppers, refuse to eat most forms of garlic and onions, and almost never eat spicy food


[11-Aug-21 07:36 PM] kingofcats#9205
i'm just odd


[11-Aug-21 07:36 PM] kingofcats#9205
told you it was crazy :3


[11-Aug-21 07:47 PM] kingofcats#9205
lmfao dw :3

ohhh that's niceeee


[11-Aug-21 08:01 PM] kingofcats#9205
how has your day been?


[11-Aug-21 08:02 PM] kingofcats#9205
also i want to wear night contacts at school but that depends on how much sleep i average lmfao, i can't wear em if i sleep less than 7 hours


[11-Aug-21 08:03 PM] kingofcats#9205
wait jenny do you also wear them???


[11-Aug-21 08:03 PM] kingofcats#9205
ohhhh


[11-Aug-21 08:03 PM] kingofcats#9205

[11-Aug-21 08:04 PM] kingofcats#9205

omg pls be careful though
i scarred my cornea a few years ago and my optometrist is always like "the scar is still there"


[11-Aug-21 08:05 PM] kingofcats#9205
i honestly don't know, i just had a hard time taking them out one day and then i managed to injure my right eye :3


[11-Aug-21 08:06 PM] kingofcats#9205
that's why you gotta be careful cause if it happens too many times/a lot of damage happens no more night time contacts


[11-Aug-21 08:07 PM] kingofcats#9205
yeah it really gets difficult


[11-Aug-21 08:07 PM] kingofcats#9205
i can't imagine how cosplay contacts feel, esp sclera ones


[11-Aug-21 08:07 PM] kingofcats#9205
also @Viridion hi!!!! how has your day been?


[11-Aug-21 08:09 PM] kingofcats#9205
i don't know how people do those contacts cause i swear it's hard plastic in your eye


[11-Aug-21 08:10 PM] kingofcats#9205
lmao felt that


[11-Aug-21 08:11 PM] kingofcats#9205
lmaooo have funnnnnnnn :3


[11-Aug-21 08:12 PM] kingofcats#9205
ahahah okay :3


[11-Aug-21 08:12 PM] kingofcats#9205
i feel like most people are busy rn, though i don't know why


[11-Aug-21 08:17 PM] kingofcats#9205
y e s ss


[11-Aug-21 08:18 PM] kingofcats#9205
i hope more people slowly start to get active here in the chat :3


[11-Aug-21 08:18 PM] kingofcats#9205
i want more friends to chat with ahahah


[11-Aug-21 08:19 PM] kingofcats#9205
yeah mostly girls


[11-Aug-21 08:19 PM] kingofcats#9205
so far i think i've seen a handful of guys drop by but not many


[11-Aug-21 08:20 PM] kingofcats#9205
i swear this chat doesn't bite and i can make a bunch of puns related to cats and animals on purpose if that sets anyone at ease lmfao


[11-Aug-21 08:21 PM] kingofcats#9205
oml that would be so helpful!!!!!!!!!!


[11-Aug-21 08:21 PM] kingofcats#9205
yes and it would be great if it could get updates on wherever construction is


[11-Aug-21 08:22 PM] kingofcats#9205
i think you'd need a few things


[11-Aug-21 08:22 PM] kingofcats#9205
but otherwise it's pretty do-able


[11-Aug-21 08:22 PM] kingofcats#9205
yes


[11-Aug-21 08:23 PM] kingofcats#9205
it would be like waze but ucsd only


[11-Aug-21 08:23 PM] kingofcats#9205
i think you might need a data set or take data from google maps lmfao


[11-Aug-21 08:24 PM] kingofcats#9205
omg that's cool


[11-Aug-21 08:24 PM] kingofcats#9205
but also, i would still get lost with the map lmfao


[11-Aug-21 08:25 PM] kingofcats#9205
i wish it was an app


[11-Aug-21 08:25 PM] kingofcats#9205
but honestly having a living breathing person is 100x better than a map


[11-Aug-21 08:25 PM] kingofcats#9205
lmaoooo


[11-Aug-21 08:26 PM] kingofcats#9205
sometimes i find myself forgetting my lefts and rights


[11-Aug-21 08:27 PM] kingofcats#9205
ohhhhh that actually seems nicer and easier to use


[11-Aug-21 08:27 PM] kingofcats#9205
i think that's all ux stuff then


[11-Aug-21 08:31 PM] kingofcats#9205
i took a ux design class


[11-Aug-21 08:32 PM] kingofcats#9205
lmaooo it could be cute


[11-Aug-21 08:33 PM] kingofcats#9205
ahahah people are indeed difficult


[11-Aug-21 08:33 PM] kingofcats#9205
especially eyes


[11-Aug-21 08:34 PM] kingofcats#9205
i've seen many wonkily drawn humanoid beings


[11-Aug-21 08:34 PM] kingofcats#9205
hands and arms though


[11-Aug-21 08:34 PM] kingofcats#9205
i've seen those go wrong so many times


[11-Aug-21 08:34 PM] kingofcats#9205
honestly just drawing is hard


[11-Aug-21 08:34 PM] kingofcats#9205
that's cool


[11-Aug-21 08:34 PM] kingofcats#9205
i like bones but not in that sense


[11-Aug-21 08:35 PM] kingofcats#9205
i like the bones in human anatomy collections


[11-Aug-21 08:35 PM] kingofcats#9205
lmaooo i did not


[11-Aug-21 08:35 PM] kingofcats#9205
i learned the anatomical term which i also promptly forgot


[11-Aug-21 08:35 PM] kingofcats#9205
but i still have my human anatomy coloring book


[11-Aug-21 08:37 PM] kingofcats#9205
that last bit i felt


[11-Aug-21 08:37 PM] kingofcats#9205
that's why i write and read fiction


[11-Aug-21 08:37 PM] kingofcats#9205
i feel like fiction really gives you the snapshot into someone's mind


[11-Aug-21 08:38 PM] kingofcats#9205
ye s


[11-Aug-21 08:40 PM] kingofcats#9205
did you read any good books recently???


[11-Aug-21 08:59 PM] kingofcats#9205
ahahah lmao


[11-Aug-21 08:59 PM] kingofcats#9205
oooh tell me if it's good, i need to get back into reading cause i'm bringing some books with me to campus


[11-Aug-21 09:01 PM] kingofcats#9205
lmaooo it is :3
maybe if i have a stove, the energy, and the time i‚Äôll make it and you can try it lmfao


[11-Aug-21 09:04 PM] kingofcats#9205
i technically know how to make it


[11-Aug-21 09:34 PM] kingofcats#9205
it does kinda sound like one ahahah


[11-Aug-21 10:39 PM] kingofcats#9205
omg i just realized the giraffe is still nameless or do you normally not name the animals you draw?


[11-Aug-21 10:41 PM] kingofcats#9205
hi ethannnnnn


[11-Aug-21 10:44 PM] kingofcats#9205
when did we decide the giraffe was male


[11-Aug-21 10:52 PM] kingofcats#9205
you and sam originally referred to the giraffe as him lmfao


[11-Aug-21 10:56 PM] kingofcats#9205
that's not what the edited thing next to your message says lmfao


[11-Aug-21 10:59 PM] kingofcats#9205
ethan that sounds like something a toddler would say after eating all the cookies before dinner


[11-Aug-21 11:01 PM] kingofcats#9205
hi sammmmmmmm


[11-Aug-21 11:01 PM] kingofcats#9205
lmfao


[11-Aug-21 11:24 PM] kingofcats#9205
hi adriannnnnn :3


[11-Aug-21 11:25 PM] kingofcats#9205

[12-Aug-21 12:01 AM] kingofcats#9205
okay i just realized that besides adrian, i only know one other person from muir that i can remember lmfao


[12-Aug-21 12:02 AM] kingofcats#9205
omg lydiaaaaaaaaa hiiiiiiiiiiiiii


[12-Aug-21 12:02 AM] kingofcats#9205
also adrian was just asking who was from muir!


[12-Aug-21 12:02 AM] kingofcats#9205
yay i know three people!!! :3


[12-Aug-21 12:03 AM] kingofcats#9205
i say just asking as if over 30 minutes haven't passed lmao


[12-Aug-21 12:03 AM] kingofcats#9205
ahahahah honestly idk how many people i know from revelle


[12-Aug-21 12:04 AM] kingofcats#9205
i've lost track of all the people who messaged me from diff group chats + instagram i-


[12-Aug-21 12:04 AM] kingofcats#9205
i am not social actually


[12-Aug-21 12:04 AM] kingofcats#9205
that was back when i was still kinda feeling awkward


[12-Aug-21 12:05 AM] kingofcats#9205
these people just randomly messaged me i-


[12-Aug-21 12:05 AM] kingofcats#9205
yes :3


[12-Aug-21 12:05 AM] kingofcats#9205
lmao


[12-Aug-21 12:05 AM] kingofcats#9205
and i gained like 300 followers after committing to ucsd, it was kinda terrifying


[12-Aug-21 12:05 AM] kingofcats#9205
angrycloudkitty


[12-Aug-21 12:06 AM] kingofcats#9205
and ofc my username has something to do with cats lmfao


[12-Aug-21 12:06 AM] kingofcats#9205
already approved it lmao & send a request back ahahah :3


[12-Aug-21 12:09 AM] kingofcats#9205
i spent a lot of my summer just following people back


[12-Aug-21 12:09 AM] kingofcats#9205
and getting messages


[12-Aug-21 12:09 AM] kingofcats#9205
and answering them i-


[12-Aug-21 12:11 AM] kingofcats#9205
honestly i blame myself for being like lemme post an intro!


[12-Aug-21 12:11 AM] kingofcats#9205
ahahah i was quite impulsive and did it


[12-Aug-21 12:11 AM] kingofcats#9205
and then i basked in regret as the messages came in and people thought i was interesting enough to message


[12-Aug-21 12:12 AM] kingofcats#9205
i wasn't emotionally prepared for people to actually message me though ;w;


[12-Aug-21 12:14 AM] kingofcats#9205
it's fine no one messages me anymore, even those weird scammy sugar parent accounts


[12-Aug-21 12:14 AM] kingofcats#9205
well i had a a female person message me and i've had a male person message me too


[12-Aug-21 12:14 AM] kingofcats#9205
so i figured parent was most inclusive


[12-Aug-21 12:17 AM] kingofcats#9205
i think the most awkward convo i had was one where someone reached out to me about lore for middle earth despite only watching the movies


[12-Aug-21 12:17 AM] kingofcats#9205
either way


[12-Aug-21 12:17 AM] kingofcats#9205
i think it's more fun getting to know everyone here!


[12-Aug-21 12:18 AM] kingofcats#9205
i wish more people who are online would talk h e r e


[12-Aug-21 12:18 AM] kingofcats#9205
i swear i say this so often


[12-Aug-21 12:19 AM] kingofcats#9205
yeah omg that discord is huge and i just kinda don't have the energy to keep up with all those people


[12-Aug-21 12:20 AM] kingofcats#9205
i get kinda curious sometimes as to why people don't chat here more


[12-Aug-21 12:20 AM] kingofcats#9205
i mean originally i didn't cause it was really really really dead lmfao


[12-Aug-21 12:22 AM] kingofcats#9205
that would make for an interesting question to pose


[12-Aug-21 12:22 AM] kingofcats#9205
okay but i like to think that i'm capable of talking to almost anyone so long as there's a shared language


[12-Aug-21 12:23 AM] kingofcats#9205
oh and i can't be anxious either


[12-Aug-21 12:23 AM] kingofcats#9205
but if both conditions are met, whatever people want to talk about at the very least, i'm willing to listen to hours upon hours of their interests


[12-Aug-21 12:23 AM] kingofcats#9205
hello ethannnnnnnnnn


[12-Aug-21 12:24 AM] kingofcats#9205
i have very rant-y relatives so i can handle hours of stuff i don't understand or know much about


[12-Aug-21 12:24 AM] kingofcats#9205
it wasn't by choice tho


[12-Aug-21 12:25 AM] kingofcats#9205
~~i learned to sew because i wanted to~~


[12-Aug-21 12:27 AM] kingofcats#9205
yikes my friends from a diff gc are telling me i'm not active enough oops


[12-Aug-21 12:28 AM] kingofcats#9205
oh it's half alive half dead


[12-Aug-21 12:28 AM] kingofcats#9205
i apparently haven't been replying to messages


[12-Aug-21 12:28 AM] kingofcats#9205
okay but lowkey is anyone else left handed here?


[12-Aug-21 12:29 AM] kingofcats#9205
usually i can see people's handedness irl but can't really see that on zoom, same with height ngl lmfao


[12-Aug-21 12:32 AM] kingofcats#9205
hi jennyyyyy


[12-Aug-21 12:32 AM] kingofcats#9205
also warning: i took a melatonin to ensure i go to bed sometime early so i might disappear


[12-Aug-21 12:33 AM] kingofcats#9205
that's so interesting!!


[12-Aug-21 12:34 AM] kingofcats#9205
i type a lot so i am very quick with my words


[12-Aug-21 12:34 AM] kingofcats#9205
i learned how to use a mouse and draw with one using my right hand but i do practically everything else with my left hand


[12-Aug-21 12:34 AM] kingofcats#9205
i mean i could see you were typing :3


[12-Aug-21 12:36 AM] kingofcats#9205
well i can't exactly use power tools without being extremely careful


[12-Aug-21 12:36 AM] kingofcats#9205
:3


[12-Aug-21 12:36 AM] kingofcats#9205
they do but it's uncommon


[12-Aug-21 12:36 AM] kingofcats#9205
usually if you go out places, then you end up seeing the right handed mouse


[12-Aug-21 12:36 AM] kingofcats#9205
i also learned to flip right handed scissors


[12-Aug-21 12:38 AM] kingofcats#9205
i have to turn them the other way


[12-Aug-21 12:38 AM] kingofcats#9205
like usually you hold them one way, i use them in the mirror of that


[12-Aug-21 12:40 AM] kingofcats#9205
i'll just take a picture


[12-Aug-21 12:41 AM] kingofcats#9205

aerin1.txt_Files\image0-8F7CD.jpg


[12-Aug-21 12:41 AM] kingofcats#9205
usually people use it the other way


[12-Aug-21 12:42 AM] kingofcats#9205
i mean that way


[12-Aug-21 12:42 AM] kingofcats#9205
ugh my brain


[12-Aug-21 12:42 AM] kingofcats#9205
i flip it


[12-Aug-21 12:42 AM] kingofcats#9205
so you see


[12-Aug-21 12:42 AM] kingofcats#9205
like the other side


[12-Aug-21 12:43 AM] kingofcats#9205
hi sammmmmmmmm


[12-Aug-21 12:43 AM] kingofcats#9205
who me?


[12-Aug-21 12:43 AM] kingofcats#9205
i have an average of about 60 wpm


[12-Aug-21 12:43 AM] kingofcats#9205
i mean it fluctuates


[12-Aug-21 12:44 AM] kingofcats#9205
idk i could check i still have the results i had to submit for a class i took


[12-Aug-21 12:45 AM] kingofcats#9205
oops


[12-Aug-21 12:45 AM] kingofcats#9205
it was 65 wpm with a 98% accuracy


[12-Aug-21 12:46 AM] kingofcats#9205
it was the one minute test


[12-Aug-21 12:46 AM] kingofcats#9205
i highly doubt i could do the 30 second test and have a decent accuracy


[12-Aug-21 12:47 AM] kingofcats#9205
i had to do one minute because my prof said so


[12-Aug-21 12:47 AM] kingofcats#9205
it was for a transcription class


[12-Aug-21 12:49 AM] kingofcats#9205
ooooh niceeeeeeeeeee


[12-Aug-21 12:49 AM] kingofcats#9205
what's your wpm?


[12-Aug-21 12:50 AM] kingofcats#9205
yeah it was medical healthcare transcription, i originally took it to learn about chart notes cause i was curious


[12-Aug-21 12:50 AM] kingofcats#9205
it was pretty fun lmao sam types hella fast


[12-Aug-21 12:51 AM] kingofcats#9205
i know right?


[12-Aug-21 12:53 AM] kingofcats#9205
honestly i've just given up and started going with y'all and everyone


[12-Aug-21 12:53 AM] kingofcats#9205
same but also some ppl have dysphoria


[12-Aug-21 12:53 AM] kingofcats#9205
i honestly just go with whatever pops in my head first lmfao


[12-Aug-21 12:55 AM] kingofcats#9205
if i don't know what to do i usually just insert either a meow or something cat related


[12-Aug-21 12:55 AM] kingofcats#9205
it's solved all my problems so far


[12-Aug-21 12:55 AM] kingofcats#9205
i don't see why it can't continue to :3


[12-Aug-21 12:57 AM] kingofcats#9205
lmfao i think the most random thing i started saying recently is ara ara~


[12-Aug-21 12:57 AM] kingofcats#9205
and that's because the bot that tells me i've leveled up says ara ara~ so i reply with one too


[12-Aug-21 12:57 AM] kingofcats#9205
because i talk to bots


[12-Aug-21 12:58 AM] kingofcats#9205
lmfaoooo


[12-Aug-21 12:58 AM] kingofcats#9205
nya is not one of the things i would say


[12-Aug-21 12:58 AM] kingofcats#9205
someone replied to me with that once though


[12-Aug-21 12:59 AM] kingofcats#9205
i also accidentally caused my guild to go a tiny bit crazy :3


[12-Aug-21 12:59 AM] kingofcats#9205
okay i should really sleep i-


[12-Aug-21 12:59 AM] kingofcats#9205
ahahaha


[12-Aug-21 12:59 AM] kingofcats#9205
lmfao i remember people would overuse xD


[12-Aug-21 12:59 AM] kingofcats#9205
wild times


[12-Aug-21 01:00 AM] kingofcats#9205
i probably shouldn't have posted my lazy halloween costume, i'll prob never hear the end of it hahah


[12-Aug-21 01:00 AM] kingofcats#9205
oh my fave thing is the cat face :3


[12-Aug-21 01:00 AM] kingofcats#9205
i do it all the time


[12-Aug-21 01:01 AM] kingofcats#9205
idk about that people went crazy over it


[12-Aug-21 01:01 AM] kingofcats#9205
not that i get why


[12-Aug-21 01:03 AM] kingofcats#9205
nope


[12-Aug-21 01:04 AM] kingofcats#9205

[12-Aug-21 01:04 AM] kingofcats#9205

[12-Aug-21 01:05 AM] kingofcats#9205
it isssss


[12-Aug-21 01:05 AM] kingofcats#9205
best halloween costume ever


[12-Aug-21 01:05 AM] kingofcats#9205
i think i originally took the pictures just in case my middle college yearbook didn‚Äôt have enough halloween pics in my junior year


[12-Aug-21 01:05 AM] kingofcats#9205
but it was never used ahaha


[12-Aug-21 01:07 AM] kingofcats#9205
lmaooooo i was in yearbook so i kinda felt bad for the halloween team and was gonna submit it


[12-Aug-21 01:07 AM] kingofcats#9205
but they got it figured out

[12-Aug-21 08:21 AM] kingofcats#9205
y e s


[12-Aug-21 08:21 AM] kingofcats#9205
there‚Äôs also ev 2 to do


[12-Aug-21 08:22 AM] kingofcats#9205
true


[12-Aug-21 08:22 AM] kingofcats#9205
was it? lmao oops


[12-Aug-21 08:26 AM] kingofcats#9205
it sounds like multiplication though


[12-Aug-21 08:26 AM] kingofcats#9205
when someone says ‚Äúproduct‚Äù doesn‚Äôt that usually mean multiply?


[12-Aug-21 08:27 AM] kingofcats#9205
it sounds like they‚Äôre asking you to make sure that you find the pair of numbers that make the largest positive product


[12-Aug-21 08:34 AM] kingofcats#9205
i interpreted that as either submitting [4,1] or just [4] since it's four that maximizes not really 1


[12-Aug-21 08:35 AM] kingofcats#9205
but it could also be what alex said


[12-Aug-21 08:36 AM] kingofcats#9205
[ -3, 5, 7, 0]


[12-Aug-21 08:42 AM] kingofcats#9205
no problem :3


[12-Aug-21 08:43 AM] kingofcats#9205
zoe, we have discussion in 2 minutes, you could ask for clarification then :3


[12-Aug-21 01:12 PM] kingofcats#9205
either i can't spell or google can't spell

[12-Aug-21 01:14 PM] kingofcats#9205
i-


[12-Aug-21 03:45 PM] kingofcats#9205
oh well, can't drive anyway


[12-Aug-21 03:45 PM] kingofcats#9205
they need a giant parking structure


[12-Aug-21 03:54 PM] kingofcats#9205
omg yes


[12-Aug-21 03:54 PM] kingofcats#9205
and i hope they make it a pretty parking structure too


[12-Aug-21 05:09 PM] kingofcats#9205
my lungs hurt from laughing i-


[12-Aug-21 05:14 PM] kingofcats#9205
hi jennyyyyyyy


[12-Aug-21 05:14 PM] kingofcats#9205
okay so it wasn't a breakout room


[12-Aug-21 05:14 PM] kingofcats#9205
i dropped by acm and then went back to main session


[12-Aug-21 05:14 PM] kingofcats#9205
and gary was there


[12-Aug-21 05:15 PM] kingofcats#9205
and it was great :3


[12-Aug-21 05:15 PM] kingofcats#9205
yes


[12-Aug-21 05:15 PM] kingofcats#9205
he was hanging out in the main room lmfao


[12-Aug-21 05:15 PM] kingofcats#9205
i wasn't sure if i wanted to check out any of the other groups so i took a break there


[12-Aug-21 05:15 PM] kingofcats#9205
and then gary appeared


[12-Aug-21 05:15 PM] kingofcats#9205
and then i never left ahahah


[12-Aug-21 05:17 PM] kingofcats#9205
honestly same i kinda got hit with zoom fatigue


[12-Aug-21 05:18 PM] kingofcats#9205
which is weird cause usually i'm in front of my computer for hours


[12-Aug-21 05:19 PM] kingofcats#9205
i thought my humanities were waived for revelle and they weren't


[12-Aug-21 05:19 PM] kingofcats#9205
instead they waived my sciences


[12-Aug-21 05:22 PM] kingofcats#9205
why does discord have such weird emote names


[12-Aug-21 05:22 PM] kingofcats#9205
like why is disappointed_relieved a thing


[12-Aug-21 05:22 PM] kingofcats#9205
ahahah same i haven't actually given it any thought lmfao


[12-Aug-21 05:23 PM] kingofcats#9205
i need to do that


[12-Aug-21 05:24 PM] kingofcats#9205
ahahah i'm looking at their default plan and crossing off a bunch of whatever doesn't apply to me which is a fair bit


[12-Aug-21 05:25 PM] kingofcats#9205
ohhhh that's a fair concern


[12-Aug-21 05:25 PM] kingofcats#9205
a trick i've seen some students do is take some ges at community college over summer


[12-Aug-21 05:26 PM] kingofcats#9205
idk where they were in their progress towards graduation but it was something i saw often during summers


[12-Aug-21 05:26 PM] kingofcats#9205
i'm actually kinda curious about the hum classes


[12-Aug-21 05:26 PM] kingofcats#9205
i only got 1 waived


[12-Aug-21 05:26 PM] kingofcats#9205
yeah


[12-Aug-21 05:26 PM] kingofcats#9205
i took more than enough college classes to technically have them all waived


[12-Aug-21 05:26 PM] kingofcats#9205
but they were like nope


[12-Aug-21 05:27 PM] kingofcats#9205
you can check your degree audit


[12-Aug-21 05:27 PM] kingofcats#9205
that's how i found out revelle decide to take my science instead of my humanities


[12-Aug-21 05:27 PM] kingofcats#9205
the degree audit is in tritonlink :3


[12-Aug-21 05:27 PM] kingofcats#9205
honestly i'm so glad they took my science, my chemistry and physics were not fun


[12-Aug-21 05:28 PM] kingofcats#9205
plus the physics i took wasn't lab physics ahahah


[12-Aug-21 05:28 PM] kingofcats#9205
but idk what to expect with humanities ahahah


[12-Aug-21 05:29 PM] kingofcats#9205
ahahah


[12-Aug-21 05:29 PM] kingofcats#9205
i'm like humanities > stem because i can make more things up ahahah


[12-Aug-21 05:30 PM] kingofcats#9205
oh wow


[12-Aug-21 05:30 PM] kingofcats#9205
that's super niceeeeee


[12-Aug-21 05:30 PM] kingofcats#9205
i have to retake calc bc since i dropped it a while back


[12-Aug-21 05:30 PM] kingofcats#9205
i'm looking at the humanities sequences for revelle


[12-Aug-21 05:31 PM] kingofcats#9205
and they're kinda funny


[12-Aug-21 05:31 PM] kingofcats#9205
it's like whap


[12-Aug-21 05:31 PM] kingofcats#9205
honestly it all sounds like history


[12-Aug-21 05:32 PM] kingofcats#9205
i did quite well in whap so i think i'll be fine


[12-Aug-21 05:33 PM] kingofcats#9205
depends what classes


[12-Aug-21 05:34 PM] kingofcats#9205
^^^


[12-Aug-21 05:35 PM] kingofcats#9205
ohhhh specialization!!! which one???


[12-Aug-21 05:35 PM] kingofcats#9205
ohhhh that's nice


[12-Aug-21 05:35 PM] kingofcats#9205
practically everyone i know is like TAKE A CS MINOR WITH YOUR MAJOR


[12-Aug-21 05:35 PM] kingofcats#9205
so watch me not sleep :3


[12-Aug-21 05:36 PM] kingofcats#9205
it's fine though cause i know a few other night owls lmfao


[12-Aug-21 05:36 PM] kingofcats#9205
i mean i figure as long as i pass the math classes, i can make my humanities carry my gpa lmfao


[12-Aug-21 05:40 PM] kingofcats#9205
can anyone from revelle tell me how hard the humanities reqs are?


[12-Aug-21 05:46 PM] kingofcats#9205
ahahah


[12-Aug-21 05:59 PM] kingofcats#9205
good luck jennyyyy


[12-Aug-21 06:00 PM] kingofcats#9205
oh okay then that's not that bad at all lmao


[12-Aug-21 06:01 PM] kingofcats#9205

[12-Aug-21 06:05 PM] kingofcats#9205
i'm p sure you need to email your college's advisor


[12-Aug-21 06:12 PM] kingofcats#9205
i'm finally planning things out and i keep smudging my writing i- 
;w;


[12-Aug-21 06:14 PM] kingofcats#9205
that's honestly a great idea lmao
i would if i didn't particularly prefer paper


[12-Aug-21 06:19 PM] kingofcats#9205
we need that


[12-Aug-21 06:19 PM] kingofcats#9205
i will probably have really random questions


[12-Aug-21 06:19 PM] kingofcats#9205
also i just looked at my remaining revelle ge's and i don't have much lmao


[12-Aug-21 06:19 PM] kingofcats#9205
y e s


[12-Aug-21 06:20 PM] kingofcats#9205
lmaooo zoe i technically will have six years of college by the time i graduate
not sure how lucky that is lmfao


[12-Aug-21 06:20 PM] kingofcats#9205
ohhhhhhhhhhh that's cool!


[12-Aug-21 06:21 PM] kingofcats#9205
i spent 2 years as a full time cc student :3


[12-Aug-21 06:21 PM] kingofcats#9205
while in high school ofc


[12-Aug-21 06:21 PM] kingofcats#9205
honestly though cc is wild, i had one cc on semester and that was my main one but i also did some classes with a diff one on quarter and their breaks *never* aligned


[12-Aug-21 06:45 PM] kingofcats#9205
ahahah i forgot about those despite getting pings for it ahahah


[12-Aug-21 06:58 PM] kingofcats#9205
so according to what i heard yesterday at the revelle thingy i attended they said we don't have a first and second pass for this upcoming enrollment


[12-Aug-21 06:58 PM] kingofcats#9205
but if you're not sure, you should def drop by your college's web registration webinar or watch the recording if they have one up


[12-Aug-21 07:00 PM] kingofcats#9205
also hi josh :3


[12-Aug-21 07:00 PM] kingofcats#9205
wow now you're orange!!!


[12-Aug-21 07:04 PM] kingofcats#9205
because time flies :3


[12-Aug-21 07:13 PM] kingofcats#9205
i had all summer to sleep


[12-Aug-21 07:13 PM] kingofcats#9205
but instead i stayed up late


[12-Aug-21 07:14 PM] kingofcats#9205
i napped *sooooo* much during my final semester of high school, i can't tell you what was happening in any of my classes


[12-Aug-21 07:15 PM] kingofcats#9205
josh, are you in a different time zone or do you just like staying up late?
i usually see you're still on at like 1-2 am


[12-Aug-21 07:17 PM] kingofcats#9205
ohhhhh that makes a lot of sense, i'm usually up at that time unless i've brute forced myself into sleeping earlier


[12-Aug-21 07:17 PM] kingofcats#9205
you should join our 12 am convos if you have timeeee


[12-Aug-21 08:38 PM] kingofcats#9205
i think i finished planning my four years, my brain hurts and unless i space things out i'll be graduating by fall 2024 i-


[12-Aug-21 08:39 PM] kingofcats#9205
hi alexxxxxxxxxxxxxxx


[12-Aug-21 08:39 PM] kingofcats#9205
i have to space stuff out but it would be with a bs in cog sci w/ my specialization + cs minor


[12-Aug-21 08:39 PM] kingofcats#9205
all that's contingent on me actually getting classes as planned


[12-Aug-21 08:39 PM] kingofcats#9205
but i had 90.5 units to start


[12-Aug-21 08:40 PM] kingofcats#9205
i'm not lmfao


[12-Aug-21 08:40 PM] kingofcats#9205
i have to put in some of those "fun" classes because rn it's just jam packed full of my major + proposed minor classes


[12-Aug-21 08:40 PM] kingofcats#9205
i just didn't put in the "fun" classes cause lazy


[12-Aug-21 08:41 PM] kingofcats#9205
i only put one and that was literally a marine bio class


[12-Aug-21 08:41 PM] kingofcats#9205
i feel *slightly*  pressured by my parents to take a bunch of cog sci electives


[12-Aug-21 08:42 PM] kingofcats#9205
omg film sounds fun!!!!!!!!


[12-Aug-21 08:42 PM] kingofcats#9205
yeah i think i have a few too many cog sci electives on my thing but i also stopped counting cause it got difficult


[12-Aug-21 08:43 PM] kingofcats#9205
sql? isn't that a language?

{Reactions}
‚ÄºÔ∏è 

[12-Aug-21 08:44 PM] kingofcats#9205
i only know some languages by name cause i've heard them mentioned in passing lmfao, sql was one of them


[12-Aug-21 08:44 PM] kingofcats#9205
hi sam!!!


[12-Aug-21 08:45 PM] kingofcats#9205
i'd ask my brother for you since he knows more coding than i do, but i think i thoroughly traumatized him last time asking him to check what i was coding in python


[12-Aug-21 08:46 PM] kingofcats#9205
he's supposed to be taking a java class


[12-Aug-21 08:47 PM] kingofcats#9205
sometimes i look at sql and my brain goes "squirrel"


[12-Aug-21 08:47 PM] kingofcats#9205
i just looks so much like squirrelllllllllll


[12-Aug-21 09:39 PM] kingofcats#9205
i had a realization


[12-Aug-21 09:39 PM] kingofcats#9205
if i did math as much as i write, maybe i wouldn't have forgotten all my calculus


[12-Aug-21 09:50 PM] kingofcats#9205
it still exists


[12-Aug-21 09:50 PM] kingofcats#9205
#pet-pictures


[12-Aug-21 09:52 PM] kingofcats#9205
np :3


[12-Aug-21 10:38 PM] kingofcats#9205
anyone do anything interesting today?


[12-Aug-21 10:57 PM] kingofcats#9205
honestly the most interesting thing i did was draw a cat 30 minutes ago


[12-Aug-21 10:57 PM] kingofcats#9205
it does, i still can't drive :3


[12-Aug-21 10:57 PM] kingofcats#9205
i've seen people play it, it's very bloody :3


[12-Aug-21 10:58 PM] kingofcats#9205
also hi ethan, sam, and zoe


[12-Aug-21 10:58 PM] kingofcats#9205
my mom was yelling at me half the time when i drove one time


[12-Aug-21 10:58 PM] kingofcats#9205
that reminds me i gotta brute force my sleep


[12-Aug-21 10:59 PM] kingofcats#9205
maybe all asian mothers share one brain cell to scream at children learning to drive lmfao


[12-Aug-21 10:59 PM] kingofcats#9205
i don't really see any rush to learn though


[12-Aug-21 11:00 PM] kingofcats#9205
i won't even be taking a car to sd anywayyyyyy


[12-Aug-21 11:00 PM] kingofcats#9205
technically i only need to learn enough to pass the driving test


[12-Aug-21 11:00 PM] kingofcats#9205
if i can pass then i can get my license


[12-Aug-21 11:00 PM] kingofcats#9205
and not drive


[12-Aug-21 11:01 PM] kingofcats#9205
y'all wanna see the cat i drew?

[12-Aug-21 11:03 PM] kingofcats#9205
y e s


[12-Aug-21 11:03 PM] kingofcats#9205
i saw a picture of a cat with a bear hat thing


[12-Aug-21 11:04 PM] kingofcats#9205
but  couldn't figure out how to do the bear hat so i did a frog hat


[12-Aug-21 11:25 PM] kingofcats#9205
zoeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee


[12-Aug-21 11:25 PM] kingofcats#9205
i wanna watch you guys playyyyyyyyyyyy


[12-Aug-21 11:26 PM] kingofcats#9205

[12-Aug-21 11:26 PM] kingofcats#9205

[12-Aug-21 11:26 PM] kingofcats#9205
idk i like watching games more than i like playing them


[12-Aug-21 11:26 PM] kingofcats#9205
right the lecture


[12-Aug-21 11:27 PM] kingofcats#9205
i know i should be getting to bed buuuuuuuuuuut also staying up late


[12-Aug-21 11:28 PM] kingofcats#9205
i sit in a chair for hours and i feel nothing lmao


[12-Aug-21 11:28 PM] kingofcats#9205
ohhhhhhhhhh


[12-Aug-21 11:28 PM] kingofcats#9205
lmaoooo


[12-Aug-21 11:29 PM] kingofcats#9205
i think the only embarrassing thing that could pawsibly happen rn would be me making random faces at the camera


[12-Aug-21 11:29 PM] kingofcats#9205
idk where i show up on zooms for everyone else, but if i think no one is watching i make a weird face


[12-Aug-21 11:29 PM] kingofcats#9205
well it's funnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn


[12-Aug-21 11:30 PM] kingofcats#9205
plus if someone does catch me making a funny face, i bet it makes them laugh


[12-Aug-21 11:31 PM] kingofcats#9205
ohhhh that's fair


[12-Aug-21 11:31 PM] kingofcats#9205
yes they dooooooooo


[12-Aug-21 11:31 PM] kingofcats#9205
i like looking at people's backgrounds


[12-Aug-21 11:31 PM] kingofcats#9205
especially when they swap them around


[12-Aug-21 11:32 PM] kingofcats#9205
yayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy that's great!!!!!


[12-Aug-21 11:32 PM] kingofcats#9205
idk what i'm doing this quarter


[12-Aug-21 11:32 PM] kingofcats#9205
i made and promptly forgot what i'm taking


[12-Aug-21 11:32 PM] kingofcats#9205
like i have the thingy and then i forgot


[12-Aug-21 11:32 PM] kingofcats#9205
i think picking classes isn't that scary compared to everything else


[12-Aug-21 11:32 PM] kingofcats#9205
well it's somewhere


[12-Aug-21 11:33 PM] kingofcats#9205
i don't remember but i know i did it


[12-Aug-21 11:33 PM] kingofcats#9205
well at least you had fun!!!
also hi lydia!!! :3


[12-Aug-21 11:33 PM] kingofcats#9205
oh that reminds me zoe, are you going to get back 4 blood?


[12-Aug-21 11:33 PM] kingofcats#9205
really? i must be desensitized then


[12-Aug-21 11:34 PM] kingofcats#9205
isn't it the game that comes after dead by daylight or did i remember wrong? it's been a while


[12-Aug-21 11:34 PM] kingofcats#9205
that is fairrrrrrrrrrrrr


[12-Aug-21 11:34 PM] kingofcats#9205
oh college is social time for me


[12-Aug-21 11:35 PM] kingofcats#9205
so trueeeeee


[12-Aug-21 11:35 PM] kingofcats#9205
i think commuting can change the experience you have though


[12-Aug-21 11:36 PM] kingofcats#9205
cause my local school is sjsu and it's a full blown commuter school


[12-Aug-21 11:36 PM] kingofcats#9205
so it's a lot more like a community college where everyone just goes to class and that's it


[12-Aug-21 11:36 PM] kingofcats#9205
that is also trueeeeeeeeeee


[12-Aug-21 11:38 PM] kingofcats#9205
oh fr it is crazy expensive

[12-Aug-21 11:38 PM] kingofcats#9205
it is stressful


[12-Aug-21 11:39 PM] kingofcats#9205
oh btw i got my zombie games all muddled apparently back for blood was the one after left for dead or something


[12-Aug-21 11:40 PM] kingofcats#9205
i think i've seen someone play it?


[12-Aug-21 11:40 PM] kingofcats#9205
yayyyyyy go zoe!!! :3


[12-Aug-21 11:40 PM] kingofcats#9205
i think i watched dead by daylight 2 once


[12-Aug-21 11:40 PM] kingofcats#9205
i need to check


[12-Aug-21 11:41 PM] kingofcats#9205
yeah i saw dead by daylight 2 last month


[12-Aug-21 11:41 PM] kingofcats#9205
it was indeed difficult


[12-Aug-21 11:42 PM] kingofcats#9205
oops


[12-Aug-21 11:42 PM] kingofcats#9205
ugh


[12-Aug-21 11:42 PM] kingofcats#9205
my brain did another inside out thing

he's the creepy stalker dude who sent me his contact info a year after i blocked him


[12-Aug-21 11:53 PM] kingofcats#9205
unfortunately, one of the other girls he stalked said that police did nothing


[12-Aug-21 11:54 PM] kingofcats#9205
and what he did with that person was wayyyy worse cause he knew where they lived lmao


[12-Aug-21 11:54 PM] kingofcats#9205
i'm in no immediate danger lmao


[12-Aug-21 11:54 PM] kingofcats#9205

[12-Aug-21 11:56 PM] kingofcats#9205
he'll let go of me pretty soon cause his "dream" is to find his "the one" at college at a bus stop


[12-Aug-21 11:56 PM] kingofcats#9205
i highly doubt i'm in any danger


[12-Aug-21 11:56 PM] kingofcats#9205

[13-Aug-21 12:04 AM] kingofcats#9205

[13-Aug-21 12:04 AM] kingofcats#9205

[13-Aug-21 06:19 PM] kingofcats#9205

[13-Aug-21 07:01 PM] kingofcats#9205
ahahaha


[13-Aug-21 07:04 PM] kingofcats#9205
hi zoeeeeeee


[13-Aug-21 07:50 PM] kingofcats#9205
lmao zoe, out of context this is all quite confusing :3


[13-Aug-21 11:22 PM] kingofcats#9205
ahhhhhhhhhhhhh i knew it was stupid to start watching outlast, especially a no commentary version


[14-Aug-21 06:17 PM] kingofcats#9205

there's a valorant tournament happening soon-ish 
it's in the c/o 2025 announcements - if anyone wants the link to sign up lmk


[15-Aug-21 03:01 PM] kingofcats#9205
lmaooo i gotta do aps as well ahahah


[15-Aug-21 03:02 PM] kingofcats#9205
maybe take a small nap and then go back to it


[15-Aug-21 03:04 PM] kingofcats#9205
y e s


[15-Aug-21 03:04 PM] kingofcats#9205
even melatonin can't win against my will sometimes ahahah


[15-Aug-21 03:07 PM] kingofcats#9205
okay but my mom too


[15-Aug-21 03:18 PM] kingofcats#9205
ahahahah


[15-Aug-21 03:18 PM] kingofcats#9205
if i can force myself to not sleep after getting my covid shot, i think it's gonna take a lot more work to get me to sleep normally


[15-Aug-21 03:19 PM] kingofcats#9205
technically, i *could* wake up early and it would be much better for me than staying up late (i've tried both)
buuuuut staying up late is more convenient


[15-Aug-21 03:19 PM] kingofcats#9205
plus it's cold in the morning often


[15-Aug-21 04:10 PM] kingofcats#9205
ahahah i was supposed to be good at bio :3


[15-Aug-21 04:10 PM] kingofcats#9205
but i also ignored most of the things i learned from bio


[15-Aug-21 04:10 PM] kingofcats#9205
by much better for me, i just mean that i can get the same things done that i do at like 12am but with less trouble


[15-Aug-21 04:12 PM] kingofcats#9205
so if i really wanted to do things "properly" i should go to bed early and wake up at like 5 to 6 am


[15-Aug-21 04:22 PM] kingofcats#9205
same ahahahahah 
i rarely do things early because my brain can't think of anything lmao


[15-Aug-21 04:22 PM] kingofcats#9205
i didn't pay attention once things went online in spring 2020 ahahahah


[15-Aug-21 04:23 PM] kingofcats#9205
i took human anatomy then and then cell bio
i remember almost nothing from both


[15-Aug-21 05:10 PM] kingofcats#9205
ahahahaha i felt that


[15-Aug-21 05:10 PM] kingofcats#9205
i'm so glad no more science classes for me ahahah


[15-Aug-21 05:38 PM] kingofcats#9205
well i magically finished my science reqs


[15-Aug-21 05:55 PM] kingofcats#9205
@jennosaur‚ô°  look at this

r i g h t?


[15-Aug-21 06:02 PM] kingofcats#9205
aaaaaaa


[15-Aug-21 06:02 PM] kingofcats#9205
they should really put that on the error 404 ahahah


[15-Aug-21 06:02 PM] kingofcats#9205
a c at


[15-Aug-21 06:08 PM] kingofcats#9205
honestly i should do aps but watching ethan fight lady dimitrescuuuuuuu


[15-Aug-21 06:14 PM] kingofcats#9205
fun fact mosiac is such a wonky name that google maps doesn't recognize


[15-Aug-21 06:15 PM] kingofcats#9205
but gary did say that you can leave classes early to get to the next one


[15-Aug-21 06:23 PM] kingofcats#9205
yeah they really are


[15-Aug-21 06:23 PM] kingofcats#9205
the placement is also weird


[15-Aug-21 06:23 PM] kingofcats#9205
some classes have discussion afterwards and then the discussion is a whole 16 minutes away


[15-Aug-21 06:23 PM] kingofcats#9205
as if that was logical


[15-Aug-21 06:27 PM] kingofcats#9205
wait they are??? i thought they weren't aaaaaaa


[15-Aug-21 06:28 PM] kingofcats#9205
well ofc but if it's not mandatory üëÄ


[15-Aug-21 06:29 PM] kingofcats#9205
i won't have to stress myself as much over time conflicts if they aren't ahahah


[15-Aug-21 06:34 PM] kingofcats#9205
a r g h


[15-Aug-21 06:34 PM] kingofcats#9205
okay


[15-Aug-21 06:34 PM] kingofcats#9205
not bad


[15-Aug-21 06:35 PM] kingofcats#9205
lmaooo aps


[15-Aug-21 06:35 PM] kingofcats#9205
i just type giant paragraphs as fast as i can


[15-Aug-21 06:36 PM] kingofcats#9205
but it definitely shouldn't take too long since there are only four actual problems


[15-Aug-21 06:36 PM] kingofcats#9205
then i have to redo my four year plan again before i finish watching outlast 2


[15-Aug-21 06:38 PM] kingofcats#9205
on a far less related note, how's sunday going for everyone?


[15-Aug-21 07:00 PM] kingofcats#9205
earlier today (as in like 12 am) i finished watching outlast whistleblower so that was nice but also absolutely terrifying ahahah
otherwise it's a good day cause i'm gonna try to get my aps done fast


[15-Aug-21 07:00 PM] kingofcats#9205
how was it, ethan?


[15-Aug-21 07:01 PM] kingofcats#9205
that's goood :3


[15-Aug-21 07:02 PM] kingofcats#9205
i think omakase is like chef's pick if i remember right


[15-Aug-21 07:03 PM] kingofcats#9205
idk it came up in animal crossing


[15-Aug-21 07:03 PM] kingofcats#9205
lmfaooo i swear every drama has that moment
also yes, outlast is a horror game, i decided to watch it all before school starts


[15-Aug-21 07:04 PM] kingofcats#9205
oooh that sounds cool


[15-Aug-21 07:05 PM] kingofcats#9205
oh i don't eat raw fish but for a different reason


[15-Aug-21 07:05 PM] kingofcats#9205
i thought too hard about disney movies and now i ruined it for myself ahah


[15-Aug-21 07:06 PM] kingofcats#9205
same i don't really like fish that much


[15-Aug-21 07:06 PM] kingofcats#9205
i remember watching this tv show where people got parasites from eating raw fish


[15-Aug-21 07:06 PM] kingofcats#9205
since then, i have never even considered raw fish worth the risk to eat


[15-Aug-21 07:07 PM] kingofcats#9205
lmaooo ethan


[15-Aug-21 07:08 PM] kingofcats#9205
honestly at this point i feel like making sushi would be cheaper than buying it


[15-Aug-21 07:08 PM] kingofcats#9205
but also can't drive


[15-Aug-21 07:12 PM] kingofcats#9205
idk from what i remember it costs my mom less to go to mitsuwa to buy fish there and make sushi over going to a restaurant


[15-Aug-21 07:13 PM] kingofcats#9205
lmao


[15-Aug-21 07:15 PM] kingofcats#9205
kappa sushi is p chill


[15-Aug-21 07:15 PM] kingofcats#9205
or the inari sushi


[15-Aug-21 07:15 PM] kingofcats#9205
wait what about the ones with fish roe like the tobiko and stuff


[15-Aug-21 07:15 PM] kingofcats#9205
it is until you have too many


[15-Aug-21 07:16 PM] kingofcats#9205
what?


[15-Aug-21 07:17 PM] kingofcats#9205
lmaooooooo


[15-Aug-21 07:18 PM] kingofcats#9205
i don't usually trust airport food ngl


[15-Aug-21 07:18 PM] kingofcats#9205
same


[15-Aug-21 07:18 PM] kingofcats#9205
but i also haven't been traveling


[15-Aug-21 07:19 PM] kingofcats#9205
usually i go to the san jose airport tbh


[15-Aug-21 07:20 PM] kingofcats#9205
i like airplanes for whatever reason but i also usually never sleep on them ahahahah


[15-Aug-21 07:22 PM] kingofcats#9205
awwwww i'm glad that's no longer the case


[15-Aug-21 07:23 PM] kingofcats#9205
honestly when the plane is leaving the ground and landing are my least favorite parts


[15-Aug-21 07:23 PM] kingofcats#9205
it's like riding a rollercoaster tbh


[15-Aug-21 07:59 PM] kingofcats#9205
ahahah i'm so bad with rollercoasters because i don't scream, i just have an apparently very terrified expression as i cling to the friend next to me for dear life


[15-Aug-21 08:00 PM] kingofcats#9205
but i get on them anyway


[15-Aug-21 08:01 PM] kingofcats#9205
i'm just really quiet but clinging like a drowned cat


[15-Aug-21 08:01 PM] kingofcats#9205
okayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy :3


[15-Aug-21 08:45 PM] kingofcats#9205
pretty much just questioning its existence lmao


[15-Aug-21 08:50 PM] kingofcats#9205
lmaoooo


[15-Aug-21 08:51 PM] kingofcats#9205
at least it's all sushi ingredients


[15-Aug-21 08:51 PM] kingofcats#9205
i've also seen a recipe for a sushi cake actually


[15-Aug-21 08:52 PM] kingofcats#9205
it doesn't look like cheese ?


[15-Aug-21 08:52 PM] kingofcats#9205
i don't think so, the texture just looks off for cheese lmao


[15-Aug-21 08:52 PM] kingofcats#9205
it almost looks like how imitation crab looks but it's def not imitation crab


[15-Aug-21 08:53 PM] kingofcats#9205
oml i just remembered i need to finish transferring recipes i-


[15-Aug-21 08:53 PM] kingofcats#9205
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa i was supposed to do that this summer


[15-Aug-21 08:59 PM] kingofcats#9205
yeah i had some recipes on nyt that i want a permanent copy of


[15-Aug-21 08:59 PM] kingofcats#9205
i have like 100 pages of recipes from cookbooks and stuff


[15-Aug-21 08:59 PM] kingofcats#9205
it's honestly really soothing typing recipes


[15-Aug-21 09:01 PM] kingofcats#9205
idk i also like spending time looking through recipes and the comments


[15-Aug-21 09:05 PM] kingofcats#9205
yeah most of the comments are either saying what to change to the existing recipe or that it works or that it's a massive fail


[15-Aug-21 09:05 PM] kingofcats#9205
quite helpful ngl


[15-Aug-21 09:05 PM] kingofcats#9205
but usually when i have to type recipes it's because it's a physical book


[15-Aug-21 09:09 PM] kingofcats#9205
but that makes it less funnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn


[15-Aug-21 09:09 PM] kingofcats#9205
i like typing it


[15-Aug-21 09:09 PM] kingofcats#9205
plus i have a specific formatting thing that i've been doing


[15-Aug-21 09:09 PM] kingofcats#9205
ahahah


[15-Aug-21 10:20 PM] kingofcats#9205
hi alex w and alex h!!!!


[15-Aug-21 10:20 PM] kingofcats#9205
and y e s


[15-Aug-21 10:20 PM] kingofcats#9205
move in day is kinda exciting


[15-Aug-21 10:20 PM] kingofcats#9205
oh that is so cool!!!!!


[15-Aug-21 10:21 PM] kingofcats#9205
that is also really cool


[15-Aug-21 10:22 PM] kingofcats#9205
ahahah


[15-Aug-21 10:23 PM] kingofcats#9205
my aps was questionable


[15-Aug-21 10:23 PM] kingofcats#9205
i wasn't tired enough to actually come up with good explanations


[16-Aug-21 08:27 AM] kingofcats#9205
i did it ethan :3


[16-Aug-21 05:04 PM] kingofcats#9205
lmao same


[16-Aug-21 06:42 PM] kingofcats#9205
who is mark rober?


[16-Aug-21 06:57 PM] kingofcats#9205
ohhhh cool


[16-Aug-21 07:34 PM] kingofcats#9205
that kinda reminds me of julia tries on delish's youtube


[17-Aug-21 07:59 PM] kingofcats#9205
how has today been for everyone?


[17-Aug-21 08:46 PM] kingofcats#9205
that's niceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee


[17-Aug-21 11:07 PM] kingofcats#9205
@Cinnamon Bun i understand how you feel now having to push things back b/c of precalc
my sleep deprived brain didn't realize last week that i might have to take four more math classes so now i'm looking at seven math classes aaaaaaaaa


[17-Aug-21 11:08 PM] kingofcats#9205
i have to take 20A-E and then 18 and then 180A at the moment


[17-Aug-21 11:08 PM] kingofcats#9205
but i did ask in a different server if it's absolutely necessary


[17-Aug-21 11:08 PM] kingofcats#9205
i would like to just take 20A, 20B, and 18 in the ideal situation


[17-Aug-21 11:11 PM] kingofcats#9205
honestly this is exactly why the cognitive science 118 courses are going to be the death of me


[17-Aug-21 11:11 PM] kingofcats#9205
hi alexxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx


[17-Aug-21 11:12 PM] kingofcats#9205
oh that sounds nice alexxxxxxxxxx


[17-Aug-21 11:12 PM] kingofcats#9205
hi lydiaaaaaaaaaaaaa


[17-Aug-21 11:12 PM] kingofcats#9205
actually is anyone else cognitive science and planning to specialize in ml?


[17-Aug-21 11:12 PM] kingofcats#9205
i am genuinely curious as to how everyone else is going to handle the cogs 118 stuff


[17-Aug-21 11:13 PM] kingofcats#9205
the 118 reqs are weird


[17-Aug-21 11:13 PM] kingofcats#9205
like grad reqs don't say you have to take that much math


[17-Aug-21 11:13 PM] kingofcats#9205
but then you still do?


[17-Aug-21 11:14 PM] kingofcats#9205
i'm really trying not to look at my four year plan rn ahahahah


[17-Aug-21 11:15 PM] kingofcats#9205
hi jennyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy


[17-Aug-21 11:16 PM] kingofcats#9205
smart smart


[17-Aug-21 11:17 PM] kingofcats#9205
i didn't want to replan so my backup plan is if i cannot pawsibly convince the professors for 118B and 118D to let me take two less math classes, is probably going to either be changing specializations or just getting my b.s. with no specialization


[17-Aug-21 11:18 PM] kingofcats#9205
the only reason i even need math 20e & 180A is for that one req for the two mandatory cogsci 118A/B/C/D courses


[17-Aug-21 11:18 PM] kingofcats#9205
maybe? idk i planned in a potential cs minor when i was doing it


[17-Aug-21 11:19 PM] kingofcats#9205
but now my seven or more math classes will probably be keeping me stressed and occupied ahahah


[17-Aug-21 11:19 PM] kingofcats#9205
i mean i saw that cs majors also have a bunch of math


[17-Aug-21 11:19 PM] kingofcats#9205
but i also feel like a lot of them got more math waived than i did


[17-Aug-21 11:19 PM] kingofcats#9205
i literally just have calc 10a waived


[17-Aug-21 11:19 PM] kingofcats#9205
LOVE THAT


[17-Aug-21 11:20 PM] kingofcats#9205
i'm going to assume i can graduate in 4 years since ucsd did admit me and all


[17-Aug-21 11:20 PM] kingofcats#9205
but still i'm giving them my squintiest of squinty eyes


[17-Aug-21 11:21 PM] kingofcats#9205
i swear it's so convenient having that minor and doing the ml specialization


[17-Aug-21 11:21 PM] kingofcats#9205
imagine if i have to take math over summer


[17-Aug-21 11:21 PM] kingofcats#9205
i will cry


[17-Aug-21 11:22 PM] kingofcats#9205
if everything works out nicely then it would be so easy to complete the minor ahahah


[17-Aug-21 11:22 PM] kingofcats#9205
but how are they doing it is the real question. like what if they're doing full loads every quarter including summer -0-


[17-Aug-21 11:23 PM] kingofcats#9205
i mean next summer i have to take spanish so i don't have to take it during the year


[17-Aug-21 11:23 PM] kingofcats#9205
i have to take around seven math classes


[17-Aug-21 11:23 PM] kingofcats#9205
plus everything else


[17-Aug-21 11:23 PM] kingofcats#9205
maybe? idk


[17-Aug-21 11:23 PM] kingofcats#9205
i won't worry too much about that


[17-Aug-21 11:24 PM] kingofcats#9205
i'm more concerned about graduating in four years ahahahah


[17-Aug-21 11:24 PM] kingofcats#9205
niceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee


[17-Aug-21 11:24 PM] kingofcats#9205
a lot of my credits are general elective credits so they count for nothing that i'm aware of lmfao


[17-Aug-21 11:25 PM] kingofcats#9205
i have 32 units of electives that aren't upper division


[17-Aug-21 11:26 PM] kingofcats#9205
they're mainly ges


[17-Aug-21 11:27 PM] kingofcats#9205
yeah i have like three left


[17-Aug-21 11:27 PM] kingofcats#9205
but i'm freaked out over all the lower division reqs i have before i can take some of my upper division courses


[17-Aug-21 11:27 PM] kingofcats#9205
yes i ammmmmmmmmmm


[17-Aug-21 11:28 PM] kingofcats#9205
ahahaha i hope so


[17-Aug-21 11:29 PM] kingofcats#9205
which college are you in?


[17-Aug-21 11:29 PM] kingofcats#9205
ohhhh niceeeeeee


[17-Aug-21 11:30 PM] kingofcats#9205
is anyone else having a hard time finding "fun" classes?


[17-Aug-21 11:30 PM] kingofcats#9205
i'm slowly going through the entire course catalog trying to find something


[17-Aug-21 11:30 PM] kingofcats#9205
honestly that does sound fun, except i get the feeling there would be some papers involved


[17-Aug-21 11:30 PM] kingofcats#9205
hi again lydia!!!


[17-Aug-21 11:31 PM] kingofcats#9205
i am so scared of actually having the fun ones displace my lower division reqs


[17-Aug-21 11:33 PM] kingofcats#9205
hi joshhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh


[17-Aug-21 11:33 PM] kingofcats#9205
also that is nice advice


[17-Aug-21 11:33 PM] kingofcats#9205
^^^


[17-Aug-21 11:34 PM] kingofcats#9205
i'm planning four years, hence my panic


[17-Aug-21 11:34 PM] kingofcats#9205
i have to redo my four year plan


[17-Aug-21 11:34 PM] kingofcats#9205
rn i just have my checklist done with all the courses and backups


[17-Aug-21 11:35 PM] kingofcats#9205
well for one thing, parents
and also because i will forget i had plans and then when it's time to make decisions i will probably freak out


[17-Aug-21 11:35 PM] kingofcats#9205
so it's just best i have the idea of what i can/should do


[17-Aug-21 11:35 PM] kingofcats#9205
esp cause my goal is to keep my major and not change it lmaooo


[17-Aug-21 11:36 PM] kingofcats#9205
pretty much once i finish planning, it'll be past the point of no return


[17-Aug-21 11:36 PM] kingofcats#9205
some of them are so nice


[17-Aug-21 11:36 PM] kingofcats#9205
their only req is upper div standing


[17-Aug-21 11:37 PM] kingofcats#9205
i'm really indecisive so i'm just going to stick with my major and tough it out ahahah


[17-Aug-21 11:37 PM] kingofcats#9205
also like psych has so many ud courses that are cog sci approved electives with no or almost no prereqs

i hope both of you get the music classes y'all want :3


[17-Aug-21 11:39 PM] kingofcats#9205
i've been thinking, maybe skip the whole fun classes entirely and just do all my lower division reqs


[17-Aug-21 11:39 PM] kingofcats#9205
me feeling weirdly excited about revelle's humanities sequence

[17-Aug-21 11:42 PM] kingofcats#9205

[17-Aug-21 11:42 PM] kingofcats#9205
i only got 1 waived


[17-Aug-21 11:42 PM] kingofcats#9205

hi again joshhhhh


[17-Aug-21 11:46 PM] kingofcats#9205
there are literally piles of stuff in my room


[17-Aug-21 11:47 PM] kingofcats#9205
i just have this pile of stuff for college and half of the items are kinda getting dusty


[17-Aug-21 11:47 PM] kingofcats#9205
i have like five books


[17-Aug-21 11:48 PM] kingofcats#9205
ohhhh that's smart


[17-Aug-21 11:48 PM] kingofcats#9205
i just used a list i found from the c'o 2025 discord


[17-Aug-21 11:49 PM] kingofcats#9205
both


[17-Aug-21 11:49 PM] kingofcats#9205
apparently


[17-Aug-21 11:49 PM] kingofcats#9205
ngl my parents are making most of the executive decisions on what i'm bringing and buying lmao


[17-Aug-21 11:49 PM] kingofcats#9205
i saw calculators


[17-Aug-21 11:49 PM] kingofcats#9205
san joseeeeeeeee


[17-Aug-21 11:50 PM] kingofcats#9205
if you're taking more math, you need calculators


[17-Aug-21 11:50 PM] kingofcats#9205
graphing and maybe scientific was what the list i was looking at said


[17-Aug-21 11:50 PM] kingofcats#9205
but the type depends on the class


[17-Aug-21 11:51 PM] kingofcats#9205
i hope none of the maths i have to take need a scientific calculator


[17-Aug-21 11:51 PM] kingofcats#9205
i gave mine to my brother and i don't trust it now that he's used it for a couple of years


[17-Aug-21 11:51 PM] kingofcats#9205
i'm going to wing my first quarter


[17-Aug-21 11:51 PM] kingofcats#9205
lucky you ahahah


[17-Aug-21 11:52 PM] kingofcats#9205
my parents will be mailing whatever i forget over ahahah


[17-Aug-21 11:52 PM] kingofcats#9205
okay but of all the people i know who are in college


[17-Aug-21 11:52 PM] kingofcats#9205
i have yet to hear of one dying of stress


[17-Aug-21 11:52 PM] kingofcats#9205
so maybe it'll be okay


[17-Aug-21 11:53 PM] kingofcats#9205
i think i kinda know but it's okay cause google and upperclassmen


[17-Aug-21 11:53 PM] kingofcats#9205
if anything it seems like everyone's having fun???


[17-Aug-21 11:53 PM] kingofcats#9205
i'll have to remember to do school


[17-Aug-21 11:53 PM] kingofcats#9205
it's so easy for me to not do school


[17-Aug-21 11:54 PM] kingofcats#9205
wait what major???


[17-Aug-21 11:54 PM] kingofcats#9205
ohhhhhhh


[17-Aug-21 11:54 PM] kingofcats#9205
that's niceeeeeeee


[17-Aug-21 11:55 PM] kingofcats#9205
ohhh that's kinda cool lmao


[17-Aug-21 11:55 PM] kingofcats#9205
previously i thought maybe architecture


[17-Aug-21 11:56 PM] kingofcats#9205
i took one look at the application which ofc asked for a portfolio and was like "okay what's another major i can do"


[17-Aug-21 11:57 PM] kingofcats#9205
honestly i kinda think the design specialization would be fun


[17-Aug-21 11:57 PM] kingofcats#9205
but also


[17-Aug-21 11:58 PM] kingofcats#9205
oh my


[17-Aug-21 11:58 PM] kingofcats#9205
i couldn‚Äôt figure out how to say it


[18-Aug-21 12:00 AM] kingofcats#9205
i think the best way to put it is that design specialization usually ends with people in the ux/ui design field as far as i‚Äôm aware


[18-Aug-21 12:00 AM] kingofcats#9205
but i don‚Äôt know how that fits with what i wanna do after i graduate


[18-Aug-21 12:00 AM] kingofcats#9205
i say this to myself too


[18-Aug-21 12:00 AM] kingofcats#9205
i felt that zoe

[18-Aug-21 12:05 AM] kingofcats#9205

[18-Aug-21 12:07 AM] kingofcats#9205
not really messed up


[18-Aug-21 12:07 AM] kingofcats#9205
we missed something lmao


[18-Aug-21 12:07 AM] kingofcats#9205
jenny aren't you and your lab partner on lab 6 though


[18-Aug-21 12:07 AM] kingofcats#9205

[18-Aug-21 12:09 AM] kingofcats#9205
ours looked 600 x 800 despite the fact it wasn't


[18-Aug-21 12:09 AM] kingofcats#9205
we just left it as that


[18-Aug-21 12:09 AM] kingofcats#9205
and we moved on


[18-Aug-21 12:10 AM] kingofcats#9205
wait what do you mean by that jenny?


[18-Aug-21 12:11 AM] kingofcats#9205
my brain is buffering hard


[18-Aug-21 12:11 AM] kingofcats#9205
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa good luck


[18-Aug-21 12:11 AM] kingofcats#9205
ohhhhhhhhh


[18-Aug-21 12:12 AM] kingofcats#9205
oh wow that's a lot


[18-Aug-21 12:12 AM] kingofcats#9205
okay but my brother just started learning to use photoshop and i've just been dead inside


[18-Aug-21 12:13 AM] kingofcats#9205

[18-Aug-21 12:13 AM] kingofcats#9205

[18-Aug-21 12:13 AM] kingofcats#9205
i'm sure your teacher will understand though


[18-Aug-21 12:14 AM] kingofcats#9205
actually i just realized i don't think i've seen an art history course yet ahahahah


[18-Aug-21 12:14 AM] kingofcats#9205
zoe, maybe a break would be good


[18-Aug-21 12:14 AM] kingofcats#9205
cause it sounds like you need one


[18-Aug-21 12:17 AM] kingofcats#9205
yeah aps is due sunday lmao


[18-Aug-21 12:20 AM] kingofcats#9205
lmao jenny


[18-Aug-21 12:20 AM] kingofcats#9205
you just named something other than pygame that we learned


[18-Aug-21 12:20 AM] kingofcats#9205
sorting


[18-Aug-21 12:21 AM] kingofcats#9205
pygame feels like scratch


[18-Aug-21 12:21 AM] kingofcats#9205
but harder


[18-Aug-21 12:21 AM] kingofcats#9205
i'm honestly just learning from the labs


[18-Aug-21 12:21 AM] kingofcats#9205
i feel like doing it is easier than actually learning it from lecture


[18-Aug-21 12:22 AM] kingofcats#9205
okay but i almost never move around when i'm home


[18-Aug-21 12:22 AM] kingofcats#9205
i finally started understanding the errors recently


[18-Aug-21 12:22 AM] kingofcats#9205
and since then it's been niceeeeeeeeee


[18-Aug-21 12:23 AM] kingofcats#9205
i can technically walk more than  100 steps a day


[18-Aug-21 12:23 AM] kingofcats#9205
but i also don't want to


[18-Aug-21 12:23 AM] kingofcats#9205
^^^^


[18-Aug-21 12:23 AM] kingofcats#9205
i used to go to art museums a lot and just outdoors stuff


[18-Aug-21 12:24 AM] kingofcats#9205
and my mom always insisted on walking for hours upon hours upon hours


[18-Aug-21 12:24 AM] kingofcats#9205
so at this point it would be weird if i couldn't tolerate a lot of walking


[18-Aug-21 12:24 AM] kingofcats#9205
omg my athletic ability is just missing


[18-Aug-21 12:24 AM] kingofcats#9205
zoe walks more than i do in a day


[18-Aug-21 12:25 AM] kingofcats#9205
lmao sam


[18-Aug-21 12:25 AM] kingofcats#9205
i have 372 steps


[18-Aug-21 12:25 AM] kingofcats#9205
ohhhhh


[18-Aug-21 12:26 AM] kingofcats#9205
the last time i walked a bunch was august cause my friend and i were hanging out before they moved


[18-Aug-21 12:30 AM] kingofcats#9205
oh wowwwww


[18-Aug-21 12:30 AM] kingofcats#9205
i think the most i ever walked was around 18k steps sooo


[18-Aug-21 12:30 AM] kingofcats#9205
oh wait nevermind i found a record from 2017


[18-Aug-21 12:31 AM] kingofcats#9205
it was 26,272


[18-Aug-21 12:31 AM] kingofcats#9205
hi ethannnnnnnnnn


[18-Aug-21 12:31 AM] kingofcats#9205
my walking history is really weird to look at sometimes it's less than 100 and other times it's in the hundreds and other times it's in the thousands


[18-Aug-21 12:31 AM] kingofcats#9205
oml sameeeeee zoe


[18-Aug-21 12:32 AM] kingofcats#9205
not even thursday but thursday at 9pm ahahah

[18-Aug-21 12:34 AM] kingofcats#9205
how could you sleep through that i-


[18-Aug-21 12:34 AM] kingofcats#9205
lectures are at 8:45???


[18-Aug-21 12:35 AM] kingofcats#9205
you know what works


[18-Aug-21 12:35 AM] kingofcats#9205
siblings or parents


[18-Aug-21 12:35 AM] kingofcats#9205
my mom sometimes will just pop in if i'm off schedule and sleeping too long


[18-Aug-21 12:35 AM] kingofcats#9205
but also now that my brother is going to school there's so much noise in the morning


[18-Aug-21 12:35 AM] kingofcats#9205
cause he stomps around the house


[18-Aug-21 12:35 AM] kingofcats#9205
same but i'm skipping ahah


[18-Aug-21 12:36 AM] kingofcats#9205
i'd rather do 16 units of stuff


[18-Aug-21 12:36 AM] kingofcats#9205
good night ethan


[18-Aug-21 12:36 AM] kingofcats#9205
i don't think i could really wreck my gpa that badly


[18-Aug-21 12:36 AM] kingofcats#9205
honors sounds like stress


[18-Aug-21 12:37 AM] kingofcats#9205
oh really? weird


[18-Aug-21 12:37 AM] kingofcats#9205
i'm not even going to worry about my gpa


[18-Aug-21 12:37 AM] kingofcats#9205
i have no plans on being an honors student


[18-Aug-21 12:37 AM] kingofcats#9205
as long as i have a 3.0 i'm happy


[18-Aug-21 12:37 AM] kingofcats#9205
i'm not expecting myself to really be just peachy


[18-Aug-21 12:38 AM] kingofcats#9205
honestly i think the correct response is to kinda just let go of all the honor student stuff if it starts wrecking your mental health and stuff


[18-Aug-21 12:39 AM] kingofcats#9205
honestly i think mental pain and trauma and stuff really comes back to haunt big time


[18-Aug-21 12:39 AM] kingofcats#9205
which is why mental health matters!!!


[18-Aug-21 12:40 AM] kingofcats#9205
that's good!!!!

AGREED ! !!!


[18-Aug-21 05:08 PM] kingofcats#9205
i liked seeing everyone :3


[18-Aug-21 05:09 PM] kingofcats#9205
but it was pretty fun meeting the cog sci people


[18-Aug-21 05:36 PM] kingofcats#9205
i've been doing my four year planning and one thing i've been doing besides the spreadsheet ucsd has is making a google doc checklist that i'm probably going to print out so if anyone else is really struggling to track grad reqs, would suggest that + checking degree audit
ALSO weird thing i noticed with mainly cog sci is that some prereqs are easy to miss because they don't separate the "ands" and "ors" which is trippy (like sometimes you can pick one class that fulfills a certain preq but there aren't clear distinctions on the course catalog whereas if you look at cse they put parentheses around each prereq and its other options if it has any) and it caused me to miss a few the first go although i feel like my sleep deprivation had a role in it too


[18-Aug-21 06:02 PM] kingofcats#9205
lmfaoooooo


[18-Aug-21 06:26 PM] kingofcats#9205
y'all is there a certain sound that reminds you of home that you're going to miss?


[18-Aug-21 07:20 PM] kingofcats#9205
i'm going to miss the sound of my brother's aggressive and incessant clicking noises

{Reactions}
‚ÄºÔ∏è 

[18-Aug-21 07:20 PM] kingofcats#9205
he got this new gaming mouse that's apparently super light so his clicking is getting louder and more aggressive


[18-Aug-21 07:21 PM] kingofcats#9205
i'm just really used to that sound ahahah


[18-Aug-21 09:22 PM] kingofcats#9205
ooooh what are some mobile games y'all like playing?


[18-Aug-21 10:11 PM] kingofcats#9205

all the classes i can take that don't cause conflicts with one another are waitlisted because they're all lower division since i have practically no ges left to take :3


[19-Aug-21 10:48 PM] kingofcats#9205
math at night is walking a thin line ngl


[19-Aug-21 10:52 PM] kingofcats#9205

[19-Aug-21 10:57 PM] kingofcats#9205

[19-Aug-21 11:08 PM] kingofcats#9205
ngl i cheated on mine and just used my school's naviance to make one back in high school, not that i ever had to use it lmao


[20-Aug-21 08:10 AM] kingofcats#9205
y'all turns out i have junior standing at ucsd i-


[20-Aug-21 08:11 AM] kingofcats#9205
i thought i had sophomore but i just called the registrar's office and was told i had junior level soooo it all worked out and i got rid of a waitlist course and replaced it with a upper division elective ahahah


[20-Aug-21 08:12 AM] kingofcats#9205
oh fr?


[20-Aug-21 08:12 AM] kingofcats#9205
that's niceeeeeeeeeee


[20-Aug-21 08:13 AM] kingofcats#9205
i thought i was a sophomore cause i had 90 units but guess not lmfao


[20-Aug-21 08:13 AM] kingofcats#9205
it is a relief though


[20-Aug-21 08:13 AM] kingofcats#9205
it's nice to have an enrolled course ngl


[20-Aug-21 08:14 AM] kingofcats#9205
right???


[20-Aug-21 08:14 AM] kingofcats#9205
^^^^


[20-Aug-21 05:03 PM] kingofcats#9205
what?


[20-Aug-21 05:09 PM] kingofcats#9205
honestly i'm semi confused by the priority system (not the cse aspect but the other parts)


[20-Aug-21 05:10 PM] kingofcats#9205
how important is standing?


[20-Aug-21 05:13 PM] kingofcats#9205
ohhhhhh


[20-Aug-21 05:16 PM] kingofcats#9205
so if i'm a freshman with junior standing does that do anything to my enrollment times or something


[20-Aug-21 05:17 PM] kingofcats#9205
aside from the fact i can register for upper division courses that require a junior standing


[20-Aug-21 05:18 PM] kingofcats#9205
actually


[20-Aug-21 05:18 PM] kingofcats#9205
ohhhhhh


[20-Aug-21 05:18 PM] kingofcats#9205
that's nice


[20-Aug-21 05:18 PM] kingofcats#9205
this quarter is going to be interesting for me ig


[20-Aug-21 05:20 PM] kingofcats#9205
i'm on waitlist for two cognitive science lower division courses


[20-Aug-21 05:20 PM] kingofcats#9205
so if that doesn't work out


[20-Aug-21 05:20 PM] kingofcats#9205
i'll be taking upper division elective courses that have space with my junior standing lmfao


[20-Aug-21 05:21 PM] kingofcats#9205
yeah and it would mainly be the fault of my enrollment time lmfao


[20-Aug-21 05:27 PM] kingofcats#9205
oml that would suck


[20-Aug-21 05:27 PM] kingofcats#9205
then i'd go back to having practically nothing to do/take ahahah


[20-Aug-21 05:37 PM] kingofcats#9205
lmaooo idk most of the students i know are junior standing freshmen


[20-Aug-21 05:37 PM] kingofcats#9205
but from what i remember, a lot of y'all are sophomore standing freshmen, right?


[20-Aug-21 05:38 PM] kingofcats#9205
the major minor area


[20-Aug-21 05:38 PM] kingofcats#9205
it's open now so you can change majors and stuff


[20-Aug-21 05:43 PM] kingofcats#9205
ohhhhhhh that's interestinggggggg


[20-Aug-21 05:56 PM] kingofcats#9205
wait if i'm junior now


[20-Aug-21 05:56 PM] kingofcats#9205
what's going to happen next year?


[20-Aug-21 05:57 PM] kingofcats#9205
does that mean i'm a senior next year, that will be so weird


[20-Aug-21 06:00 PM] kingofcats#9205
3 years of being a senior??? lmfao


[20-Aug-21 06:00 PM] kingofcats#9205
right????


[20-Aug-21 06:06 PM] kingofcats#9205
lmao i know


[20-Aug-21 06:06 PM] kingofcats#9205
it would just be really funny and weird seeing senior for three years


[20-Aug-21 06:10 PM] kingofcats#9205
i know the route i took isn't that popular ngl


[20-Aug-21 06:11 PM] kingofcats#9205
mainly cause your social life gets really wrecked from it


[20-Aug-21 07:03 PM] kingofcats#9205
yeah it's just really hard to do lmao


[20-Aug-21 07:03 PM] kingofcats#9205
most of the time the schedules don't align plus you kinda get out of the loop w/ school activities if you don't try hard enough to keep up with them


[20-Aug-21 07:05 PM] kingofcats#9205
yeah!!!


[20-Aug-21 07:08 PM] kingofcats#9205
do any of y'all play identity v? i'm going to play that if anyone else wants to join myself and some of my friends from my guild lmao


[20-Aug-21 07:23 PM] kingofcats#9205
it's a multiplayer game on mobile phones


[20-Aug-21 07:24 PM] kingofcats#9205
the game is a lot like hide & seek except the seeker is dangerous


[20-Aug-21 07:26 PM] kingofcats#9205
i think it might be???


[20-Aug-21 07:27 PM] kingofcats#9205
so i googled it and yes it is like dead by daylight


[20-Aug-21 07:32 PM] kingofcats#9205
hi zoeeeeeee :3


[20-Aug-21 07:33 PM] kingofcats#9205
you could get a wheelchair?


[20-Aug-21 07:34 PM] kingofcats#9205
yes stretches are importantttt


[20-Aug-21 08:32 PM] kingofcats#9205
i think 45 units completed


[20-Aug-21 08:32 PM] kingofcats#9205
cause there's a minimum of 180 and divide it by four and it's 45


[20-Aug-21 08:32 PM] kingofcats#9205
i have 90 and i'm at junior


[20-Aug-21 08:32 PM] kingofcats#9205
so i think it's right??


[20-Aug-21 08:32 PM] kingofcats#9205
lmao mine is college credit ahah i only took 1 ap class ever


[20-Aug-21 08:37 PM] kingofcats#9205
yep they do


[20-Aug-21 08:38 PM] kingofcats#9205
i have 30.5 units in elective cred


[20-Aug-21 08:38 PM] kingofcats#9205
you might wanna call the registrar if you're unsure


[20-Aug-21 08:38 PM] kingofcats#9205
i called them and they told me my thingy


[20-Aug-21 08:42 PM] kingofcats#9205
oh god those


[20-Aug-21 08:42 PM] kingofcats#9205
i think i know what those are smh


[20-Aug-21 09:15 PM] kingofcats#9205
i mean most college wifi networks can see what you're browsing to start??


[20-Aug-21 11:22 PM] kingofcats#9205
oh that's quite interesting


[20-Aug-21 11:22 PM] kingofcats#9205
i remember my high school used to force everyone to have this one browser extension so the teachers could see what tabs people had open


[20-Aug-21 11:28 PM] kingofcats#9205

[22-Aug-21 11:41 PM] kingofcats#9205
much less the same birthday


[22-Aug-21 11:41 PM] kingofcats#9205
it's been a long time since i met someone else born in january


[22-Aug-21 11:41 PM] kingofcats#9205
like a few years


[22-Aug-21 11:41 PM] kingofcats#9205
last time i met someone born in my month was like 2, almost 3 years ago


[22-Aug-21 11:41 PM] kingofcats#9205
WAIT WHATTTTTTTTTt


[22-Aug-21 11:41 PM] kingofcats#9205
yayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy

zoeeeeeeeeeeeeee


[22-Aug-21 11:42 PM] kingofcats#9205
i still remember being in school and the only person who was also celebrating their birthday in january was the kid who had the birthday in july and had to celebrate their half birthday at school instead lmao


[22-Aug-21 11:44 PM] kingofcats#9205
i had a random late night thought: why do some games cause your phone to overheat?


[22-Aug-21 11:46 PM] kingofcats#9205
ohhhhhhhhhhh


[22-Aug-21 11:46 PM] kingofcats#9205
idv eats my battery within 3 rounds


[22-Aug-21 11:46 PM] kingofcats#9205
maybe it's partially because of my giant friendlist


[22-Aug-21 11:50 PM] kingofcats#9205
OMG JENNY


[22-Aug-21 11:50 PM] kingofcats#9205
YAYYYYYYYYYY


[22-Aug-21 11:51 PM] kingofcats#9205

[22-Aug-21 11:51 PM] kingofcats#9205
6th


[22-Aug-21 11:51 PM] kingofcats#9205
i got pulled into an idv match but i'm getting sleepy cause i took a melatonin


[22-Aug-21 11:51 PM] kingofcats#9205
what about youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu


[22-Aug-21 11:51 PM] kingofcats#9205
ohhh niceeeeeeeeee


[22-Aug-21 11:52 PM] kingofcats#9205
right?


[22-Aug-21 11:52 PM] kingofcats#9205
we're still waiting for a match


[22-Aug-21 11:53 PM] kingofcats#9205
5 minutes?


[22-Aug-21 11:53 PM] kingofcats#9205
idk


[22-Aug-21 11:53 PM] kingofcats#9205
i'm entering one rn


[22-Aug-21 11:53 PM] kingofcats#9205
we'll see how fast it takes me to die


[22-Aug-21 11:58 PM] kingofcats#9205
okay that round was exactly 5 minutes


[22-Aug-21 11:58 PM] kingofcats#9205
but i usually play back to back rounds


[22-Aug-21 11:59 PM] kingofcats#9205
and then if i'm teamed i feel bad ditching my teammate so i end up staying way too long


[22-Aug-21 11:59 PM] kingofcats#9205
i usually only run have a few?


[22-Aug-21 11:59 PM] kingofcats#9205
like three


[22-Aug-21 11:59 PM] kingofcats#9205
idv is apparently just a big game to be running


[22-Aug-21 11:59 PM] kingofcats#9205
not as bad as genshin or a webtoon game i used to play though


[22-Aug-21 11:59 PM] kingofcats#9205
genshin made my phone burn up with just loading lmfao


[23-Aug-21 12:01 AM] kingofcats#9205
lmaoooooooooo


[23-Aug-21 12:01 AM] kingofcats#9205
i think it probably didn't help that i was playing a lot for the event as well


[23-Aug-21 12:02 AM] kingofcats#9205
but it's fine cause i'm at home and i can always charge my phone :3


[23-Aug-21 12:04 AM] kingofcats#9205
well i didn't delete it over that


[23-Aug-21 12:05 AM] kingofcats#9205
there was a webtoon game that made my phone heat up within a minute of me playing for whatever reason and i kept it for a few weeks before i got bored


[23-Aug-21 12:05 AM] kingofcats#9205
i quit genshin cause i died 20 times over one tiny mission


[23-Aug-21 12:08 AM] kingofcats#9205
ahahah no i died on one of those beginner missions 20 times and just kinda went "y'know what...." and uninstalled


[23-Aug-21 12:11 AM] kingofcats#9205
idv's tutorial wasn't hard, it was just painful ngl


[23-Aug-21 12:11 AM] kingofcats#9205
there were 14 or 15 different parts to the whole thing, literal pain


[23-Aug-21 12:11 AM] kingofcats#9205
but fr sometimes the tutorials are even more confusing than the actual game


[23-Aug-21 12:13 AM] kingofcats#9205
i think the 15 parts was to kind of make sure everyone can actually play properly, which is fair because idv is kinda hard without tutorial handholding


[23-Aug-21 12:13 AM] kingofcats#9205
ZOEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEee


[23-Aug-21 12:14 AM] kingofcats#9205
i am semi-sleepy so if i disappear


[23-Aug-21 12:14 AM] kingofcats#9205
it's melatonin


[23-Aug-21 12:14 AM] kingofcats#9205
not yet


[23-Aug-21 12:14 AM] kingofcats#9205
yayyyyyyyyyyyyyy


[23-Aug-21 12:14 AM] kingofcats#9205
join usssssssssssssssss


[23-Aug-21 12:14 AM] kingofcats#9205
i only recently learned that people can play idv on pc and i was so shook


[23-Aug-21 12:15 AM] kingofcats#9205
identity v, it's like the mobile phone version of dead by daylight that's free and owned by a chinese company and semi-translated


[23-Aug-21 12:15 AM] kingofcats#9205
and by semi-translated i mean sometimes you see the errant chinese characters in aspects of the game


[23-Aug-21 12:16 AM] kingofcats#9205
all the characters also look like they're from coraline!!!


[23-Aug-21 12:16 AM] kingofcats#9205
and i currently have 90 friends despite downloading the game only around 3 days or so ago


[23-Aug-21 12:16 AM] kingofcats#9205
yeah!! most of them have button eyes


[23-Aug-21 12:17 AM] kingofcats#9205
except the hunters who according to my brother, are the equivalent of dbd's killers


[23-Aug-21 12:18 AM] kingofcats#9205
i never played dbd but my brother seems to think it's about the same as playing the mobile version of the game since ig the characters have a lot of crossover??


[23-Aug-21 12:19 AM] kingofcats#9205
lmao


[23-Aug-21 08:43 AM] kingofcats#9205
good morning alexxxxxxxxxxx :3
