I liked hanging out with the other mentor groups. So let’s do more of that 😮
yeah :3
they are on entirely different levels
@NewtonC re: gradescope account
@ aerin Thank you! It worked

might pick up making them again tbh they were fun
oh that's super cool!!!
what ab you??
i knew someone who was big on cosplay and they sell their stuff on depop

YES
i was like but why does that apply to coding too

he really grew upppppp
LITERALLY
and when seijoh lost i was also crying
brooo oikawa and iwa chan‼️

like clumsy lev ||a model!!!!!!||
girl what got blocked LMAO
it's a spoiler
it just says a model😭
i didn't want anyone new to the series to find out
yeah i remember seeing that
also iwa-chan apparently went to uc irvine
yo wait didn’t some of them go to the olympics
i don't remember if that was a headcanon or fr
YEAH
yeahhhhhhh
bro they really should’ve used that for this years omfg
along with a number of other people for the 2020 olympics
like ITS EVEN THIS YEAR-
i would have spent money on haikyuu merch for olypmic theme
i would’ve been broke🥴
they really underestimated the amount of money people would be willing to spend
so worth it tho
ye s
omg i wish bro
honestly i wish there were more places to buy stuff here
same like all i got lowk is boxlunch LMFAO
honestly they shoulddddd
like bro
i have to say the people who make the pins are cool but idk i feel like official is different
TAKE MY MONEY.
i think they do, but as a cosplay jacket
omg wait fr
yeah!!!!
brooooo
people sell those online
might just cop fr😭
back when i looked it was just aoba johsai, karasuno, nekoma, and shiratorizawa
imma see then
this was years ago though
ooh fs fs
i swear 8th grade was when everyone wanted to be edgy lmao
edgy era fr
i remember memorizing the name of bands and stuff
LMAOOOO IM DEAD
it was such a weird time
just waiting for somebody to ask name 3 bands and boom you have 10
right
i think so
honestly i remember 8th grade as the time when i think onision was big and so was shane dawson and like that era of youtubers
omg not themmm
i knowww and i knew people who watched them religiously
girl i think my homegirl had a hoodie from him like😭😭😭
honestly i also remember there being some kind of weirdly popular wattpad fic about brendon urie's forehead or something
yeah i dont remember that at all😭😭😭
probably my friend group then
maybe
but i remember they were big on twenty one pilots, fall out boy, my chemical romance, pierce the veil, falling in reverse, black veil brides, sleeping with sirens, panic at the disco, bring me the horizon and like other screamo bands
i used to be big on them in 8th grade 😭
yeah they were so popular back then
fr like i remember stressed out and ride and i think heavydirtysoul
it was so weird hearing p!atd on the radio like years later
literally tho like ??????
honestly some of the people haven't aged at all
she’s been a egirl so ahead of her time??? idfk
lmaooooo
fr like it’s either people have a 180 or stay the same lowk
i've just been about the same height since middle school i think
5’2 gang🥴
and now all the children i knew grew
felt😭😭😭
and then i end up being like offended short person noises
we almost the same im just an inch off HAHAHA
my brother likes to spite me and say i'm 5'2.5 he just really had to take that half an inch off me
i get that all the time😭😭
most of the people i meet are taller than me and then they're like wow you're short
5'2 gang 😭
okay but felt
the struggle 😩😩😩
okay but same
also hi i dont want to sleep
i drank this weird herbal concoction and hit 5'3
girl im abt to LMAO
but sleep is like hahah wait why
imma log off doeeee
okayyyyy good night to youuuuu
i’ll see yall monday😎‼️
yessssssssss :3
gn streaks🤝
umaaaaaaaaaa how has your day been?
its been pretty good! what about you?
it's been long ahahahah but i'm having fun
spis was pretty much all day today because of game night
i singlehandedly managed to get this chat live so i'm happy
yayyyy
fr fr  it was pretty much all day
i had to leave early though
it's been so nice to actually talk to people
yes its so refreshing
ohhhhhhhhhh niceeee
snickerdoodles!!
ohhhhhhhhh those are greattttttttt :3
yeah theyre my favorite
i feel like i've been deprived of social interactions for so long that now i'm overly social
i have forgotten how to talk to new peopl e
like usually i'm not this talkative
because of lockdown
but i also just don't know how to talk to people
yeah me toooo
and then i do it anyway because idk
its bc im an introvert
a quiet chat always kinda bugs me
oohh what game
same, i'm probably an ambivert leaning towards introvert
me too
it's shining nikki!
i havent heard of it
it's a newer game from the love nikki series
i think ive seen ads for that
but the guild has a discord activity requirement so i started chatting and then i couldn't stop
im so bad at games though
same
i tried playing genshin because all my friends were playing
like animal crossing pocket camp?
but i gave up at the first temple
i couldn't pass that hang glider thingy
me too omg
i died like thirty times and gave up
its so frustrating
yesssssssssssssssssss
ive heard of that toooo
but mostly it's my brother who grinds for me while i collect the characters i want
i think one of my friends plays it
honestly i like just watching people play video games
yeah same its entertaining
i also like not having to do anything lmao
its a lot less frustrating when someone else is doing all the work
i was watching a few different streams of resident evil 8 and honestly it was amazing
exactly
i ended up finding some favorite streamers through that ahahah
which streamers do you watch
corpse_husband mainly ahahahah
hes super popular
yeahhhhhh his voice is really soothing for me
ive seen some of his streams
i got into him b/c of the resi 8 stream
i used to watch his horror videos a long time ago
i thought it was hilarious
i dont think ive seen that one but maybe i should
he did two
ohh cool
his first was capcom sponsored
hopefully he'll do more
i also follow the main singer from this smaller band that i like on twitch
do you have any favorite shows
i have a bunch
i just finished fruits basket and now idk what to do with my life
haikyuu is great if you haven't seen that yet
ive seen the first season i need to keep up with it
i personally loved darling in the franxx, but it's also one of those that not everyone likes
ill definitely check those out
assassination classroom is a popular one that was pretty good
yeah i heard that one was pretty good
i mean do you have any personal preferences
i havent seen any anime in a long time but i started watching again recently
heaven's design team is a new one that is pretty good
i just looked up heavens design team and the animation is so pretty
way of the househusband is hilarious
im so bad at finishing shows though
sameeeeeee
i need to finish watching hunterxhunter
i heard that one's pretty goodddddd
yeah i can never finish dramas
oh that reminds me bungou stray dogs is pretty good
my friend really likes that one
i read an obscene amount of manga once online school started
how do u read it without getting a virus lmao
mangadex or bato.to
all the sites have so many pop ups and adblock doesnt work 😭
some scans teams also made their own sites after mangadex went down for maintenance
i heard those two closed
mangadex is adless and bato.to has some i think
i didnt know that
lmaooo i was using mangadex to read and track what i was reading so i found out all that stuff
yeah mangadex has everything
pretty much!!! they even have some doujins
i used to read it more in the beginning of high school
i started reading cause i didn't have time to watch lmao
i think thats a good thing though
lmaooooo
i always start a lot but dont finish any
i do the same thing with stuff on ao3
and then i cant tell people if theyre good or not
lmaoooo a lot of what i read is in progress
its distracting
there were a couple times where i stayed up wayyy too late reading
sameee
but it's also so bad when you're 100 chapters behind or something
then it feels overwhelming
i was around 200 chapters behind, if not more on tower of god
im so behind on tower of god
and then i stopped reading months later
idk whats happening anymore
honestly god of high school was the same
i havent read that one
and then it got too long
yeah and the auhtor went on a break so i really dont remember anythingggg
wait umaaaaaa
yes!!! omg its my favorite
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh it's so sweet i-
Omg u guys are talking this is so cool
yeah i started a conversation at like 10pm
Danggg
it was a whim kind of decision
i joined half an hour ago
i usually stay up way too late
i have randomly been checking chat like every 20 minutes
but it's really good
gourmet hound was good
i talk a lot
yess it was so sweet
the ending was so good
have any of u read its a good day to be a dog
yesssssssssss
that one was cute
the author did please take care of me in my 19th life too
yayyy omg and the author has a new series
and it's sadddddd
i love ittt
mercenary enrollment is bloody but good
is that by the same author
no
ooohh ok ill add it to my list
it's a rising one on webtoon, just started getting translated
i read like lookism weak hero and wind breaker if anyone knows those
original
yall my parents made me get off for an hour and so much has happened 😩
hardcore leveling warrior was good but i just kinda lost interest
have u read kubera
no
ive only read true beauty like a lot of ppl but its been months since ive gone on lmao
eleceed is really cuteeeeeeeee
i tried reading true beauty but i didnt like it as much
i stopped reading after a while for that one as well
i got annoyed at the mc after a bit
yesssss
yeahhh
wait have any of you read men of the harem or remarried empress
the ending was really wonky
strongest florist is pretty great
i need to catch up on remarried empress
oh it's hard to get into, definitely
usually i like stuff thats more slice-of-life than romance which is why i think i prefer gourmet hound type reads
scream queen on bilibili
ah that sounds familiar but i dont know it
suitor armor is pretty great
oo is gourmet hound good? i think it's on my list but i kinda have a long list now
yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
hmm maybe ill redownload the app and see if i have time to read it :))
i rarely keep up with the mangas or manhwas now
not too long either
no, i haven't
guys sleeping is base
lmao i'll probably have to go to sleep sometime in the next hour or so
before spis i was waking up at 11 everyday
ahahahah i kept telling myself this week i'd go to bed early so i could wake up and get good sleep before class
thats still early wow
s a m  e
i've gotten five hours most days this week lol
w h y
i think my latest wake up time this summer was like 2-3 which is way better than last summer
i ask despite having pulled an all-nighter to see what it was like
all nighters are sometimes fun
i knew a few insomniacs
amogus
so i got curious
ethan ur epic
full 24 hours
i am 😎
yeahhhhh it's not
i didnt know that was a thing
it was our mutual classmate's fault
OH
which my friend drank despite the fact you're supposed to dilute that
those things are very intense
yeah!!! for sure
dude just wanted to be awake
that i don't know lmao
secret
idk how people drink coffee black
now i just stay away
i think the only time i've heard of someone having black coffee that seemed feasible was affogato
yeah i used to drink it in middle school
my parents wouldn't let me touch that stuff
i had to search that but it looks good :o
they said it would make me short
yeah i blame it on the coffee
although they say that's also my disordered eating & messed up sleep schedule
i think its also because i went vegan in middle school LMAO
my brother had coffee when he was a child
then i gave up
i remember going to some chinese school on saturdays
i did that too
and every year they'd try to convince us kids to go vegetarian
oh interesting i wonder if it worked on people
not as far as i know
i love butter chicken too much
they also tried to convert us and make us pray
its soo good
never had butter chicken
maybe one day but im so picky hehe
i have no clue, it was a taiwanese organization that my parents registered me for
the coincidences
yessssssss
yeah my parents were so disapponted when i did chinese 1 freshman year LOLL
i use google translate so i can read
i can read pinyin and usually understand it well enough
i can't understand pinyin sometimes
omg really i wanna learn taiwanese but idk how... my parents used to just speak it so my sis and i wouldnt understand
most of my older relatives speak it
i know like 5 phrases max
oml i was so bad when i went to taiwan two or three years ago
thats usually me anyways :') oops
i can speak some taiwanese, enough to converse
ahh that would make sense but its still so cool
so it's just weird if i'm speaking taiwanese or using taiwanese phrases when they don't
unfortunately i can only chinglish but yeah i always feel so americanized whenever i reply to ppl in eng and they speak in chinese
that's a joy luck club moment i swear
and on a random note uhhh whats this girlboss cult in these peoples statuses LOL
right?
lol i just noticed that
my status is just a cat
hiding from some servers
ahahahah i did invisible for a bit but couldn't stand it
bc of pings?
and i hear the noises
i got discord recently and im still trying to figure out how to use it
plus you can sometimes hear the discord notifs in the background of your zoom
i used to be perma dnd but now i just mute the tab so sometimes during lab hrs im like... i cant hear anything...
there was this one dude in my class who would talk and there would be just the sound of discord notifs
yall take your cult away
ironically the notifs were messages from people telling him to turn on dnd
LMAO
i swear no one paid any attention in class
ok some people would do that and there are those bold ones that unmute before answering a question and you just hear them googling it frantically
i did absolutely nothing in most of my classes
this is HILARIOUS
i didn't even read some of my required reading
im actually annoyed that i did better on ap tests this year bc theye basically didnt matter
my econ/us history was like free period
oops
i was supposed to read dracula, couldn't  get interested
it became such a norm in my physics class and our teacher was so oblivious
my professors & teachers never really called on people
hmmm strange
i didn't have to read any shakespeare besides hamlet
thats a classic ive never read it before tho
the rest of my year was short stories
me too i did pretty badly on a lot of my essays but somehow did ok on the ap test *apparently*
i used to have to write art analysis critiques in my art class at high school so i got used to making things up
thats a good skill
so now my brain is just mush
i actually hope i dont go insane when in person school starts
i honestly don't know how i do it, but i have yet to encounter a teacher who finds my writing abilities bad
its been too long
earlier in the summer when everyone got their acceptances and were reaching out to make friends i got a handful of dms
oh i just didnt talk in much but yeahh i dmed some ppl about rooming and i felt SO AWK
i got dmed a bunch and i was like 0-0
o wow did you post an intro on something?
yeah i had one in revelle 2025 & one on the big ucsd.25 one
are any of u majoring in cog sci
i mean i'm also in the discord but i rarely chat there
and i think i joined loopchat/patio too late and my anxiety- i just cant speak in giant gcs
i am
:OO
oml i just got tired of the loopchat and the patio
yessss
in one of them i kept getting an at everyone ping
oh no those can get so annoying
wait what colleges are you all in
im in erc :((( idk anyone
ohhh nicee
sameeee
i'm doing ml
yeah since it overlaps
i think all i really have left are upper division courses and like the cogsci specific ones
yeah and cs is very competitive lol
i think i'm sophomore standing? idr
are there more cs classes in upper division
yeah
because i was looking at the plans thing and there were almost none in lower division
i have 90 units so i have like 90 left
sheesh, and I thought i was ballin with 56
yeah i did middle college for 11th & 12th
you could double major in 3 years i you wanted i swear
nah
yeah def dont overwork yourself
i might take a minor though
oh yeah you know how the plan says dsgn 1 or cogs 10 for first quarter? i didnt even see those courses on the website for this quarter so idk if im going crazy
i had a few classmates who completed an aa
i want to take cogs 1
yeah it's one or the other
i thought it recommended cogs 1 for second quarter but im not sure why...
its like being a full time community college student and a full time high school student
yeah it was strange the one i thought i could take didnt seem like it was offered
well i think you can swap it out unless i'm wrong
ack 2 full times at a time seems so hard
but those are all considered ge
oh only 2 hs classes? idk why i thought youd need like 6-5 hs classes + more cc ones
lmaooooo nahhh that would be wayy too crazy
yeah i was like sjfuieguoings yall do you but i could never
i honestly thought it was kinda fun
i took one cc class ever and i was already annoyed at adding another class to my schedule lmao
i got to pick my class times
no mandatory 8 am
yep!
i could never be a doctor
i mean i saw a cadaver at 14 so it wasn't that surprising
me tooo
same and then i remember the kids at the doctor's office whenever i go
people are just like ... at me whenever i get surprised by it lol thats also why i dont watch horror
i get so scared and then i watch it anyway
i dont think ive ever watched a horror movie
but i watch it even though i jump at everything
the only horror game i think ive seen is dead by daylight lmao my friends made me play for a few days
ohhh i saw that game in a stream
i dont think ive watched too much tho bc i hate the squelch noises
i had friends who liked silent hill and the pt
i havent even heard of those
silent hill is really scary ngl
ah yeah i definitely didnt know of any games back then lol
lmaooo
yeah when i spend time watching stuff i just wanna relax and not deal with that
he would go to haunted houses where you had to sign a waiver for the experience y'know of getting scared by random people who were paid to scare you
thats ppl @ me whenever i shriek seeing a spider lmaoo
oml i do too
my friends clown me sometimes
i was out walking during a summer program and i saw a bug
yuck
honestly i hope my suitemates aren't scared of bugs too
i used to not be scared of bugs in elem and i would go digging for worms or some nasty stuff like that
man guts of steel
omg i was talking to a potential roomie and she said she despised bugs and i was like OH NO
it was all so simple when we were kids
literally! i used to throw tantrums when my parents didnt let me kill the spiders LMAOOO and now spiders are my #1 fear like what happened
like i'm afraid of bugs, the other party can''t be as well
shoot i didnt ask my roomie how she was w bugs uhhh hope itll be fine
now i'm like panicked screaming
i just tell myself its a good growing experience but ew no thanks
i refuse to touch a bug without gloves on
i jus dont
i think i just got creeped out by their movement
true its ominous
i'm so strict about not having to deal with bugs ahahahah
i just shriek and hope theres someone around who can deal with it
i had a friend who's gonna be at uc berkeley who was great with bugs
i didnt ask my roomie bc we both were going to go random and decided last minute to just put each other lol
wish she came here with me ;w;
and they dont overreact
i mean i met some people who can't handle cockroaches
i cant
i hate that they can fly
no
omg the people who take pictures of bugs and post them also annoy me
bc once we were on zoom and i saw one on my bed and flipped
omg that kind of person would get blocked
i would but unfortunately probaly shouldnt lmaoo
true true
and it was more of a last summer thing so i used to be wary and barely look at the screen
my friends just send me cat pictures
so disappointing
ahahah i send my friend cat posts and then they send me some too
oh? sometimes the vibes just match and it cant be explained lmaoo
trueeeeeeeeeeeee
i used to be on cat/dog tiktok so that was a fun time but i stopped opening the app so now i just rely on random snaps
my friend and i have even characterized ourselves as cats for whatever reason
good on you for not getting that app lol i was forced to but i only used it for a month or so and it def wasnt straight tiktok
my friend told me i had the personality of a ragdoll cat lmao
i just dont go on insta enough for it to do that :'(
i just followed a bunch of tags
hmm those are cute i dont actually know cat personalitites tho lmao
and there were a bunch of cat tags ig
o wow
i was bored ngl
i didnt even realize you could follow tags uhhh im very behind on insta tech
i mean i groan whenever i get insta notifs
awwwwwwjiaweie
catttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
omg i wanna pet
it's so cuteeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
cat!
there are cats in my neighborhood and a few live like within my block
very well
there's one house with a bunch of cats living in the front yard
im already in love
sam your cat is so cuteeeeeeeeeeeeeee
can we make a pet pic channel or something
Y E S

i want
awwwww
okay like there's a pet pic channel in the 2025 discord
cookie is my favorite dog thank you ethan
but it's not enoughhhhhh
thank you, she is my favorite dog too
yeah that's cause of the perms
cookie thte dog thats adorable
but idk if we're actually allowed to since it is the game night cateogry
i feel like they wouldnt care that much? but i dont wanna
hmmmm idk where to ask lmfao

it's okay we can just spam this place
im loving this
and then ask for one tomorrow ahahah
true but its so hard to scroll back and find them if i wanted to ahahah
i wish i had a pet
me but im slightly allergic to cats
awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
lol pet brother sounds uhhh entertaining hopefulyl
lmaooo he's helpful
younger>?
he grinds my mobile games for me
we love that
y e s
yeahh i have an older sister!
ohhh cool!!!!!!!
mhm shes helpful for my uhhh boba obsession :D
lmaooooooooo
everyone knows i love it bc perhaps my pfp
lmaooooooooooo
just isnt it
taro's my personal favorite tbh
:o i actually dont think ive ever gotten it bc i dont usually like taro in other thigns
honestly i hope that by the end of five weeks, this chat is actually more active ahahahah
oh true its all artificial LOL
i've had actual taro and it was flavorless
that douesn sound too good
ahahaha i guess i'll have to be the catalyst
my mom has made "boba" out of taro and otherboba things and you cant rly taste it so its alright
i usually end up starting a bunch of conversations in a different server i'm in
maybe! or epopel will realize that this chat isnt dead and talk
Y E S i hope for that
its always weirder if its not normally too active and you try to start it
because i'm also v awkward
:o
finally figured it out ahahahah
i think there was only one server i used to be active in but then strange "drama" happend and thats why im always invis now LOL
i had a lot of practice from the other server since it's a guild server for a game where i have an activity req
ahh make ssense
i know some of the massive servers have really active chats
or its a complete other group
yep!!!!!
i definitely wouldnt remember people oops
although the kny server i'm in had a hilarious shrine for a once extremely active member of their server
omg i remember once i was kinda active on a sub only channel thing but i lost the sub and forgot everyone i talked to so those were sad hours
so for a while i thought they worshipped inosuke
idk anime references 😭
awwwwwwwwwwww that's sadddd
ok so many ppl love haikyuu i should really try to get into it but idkkk
same! i saw someone with the username iwa and immediately thought of haikyuu
one of my friends even put it in her college intro bio thing even tho she didnt finish it LMAO she said she had to do research when ppl started dming her afhiuigjkebrgreg
haikyuu is pretty fun and wholesome
isnt it long tho? i feel like i woudlnt be able to finish
i think i started in 8th grade
oh yeah i swear everyone knows it lol
i think if you're new, the anime might be easier to do over the manga
im definitely a binge watcher/reader
the anime has four seasons + the side season
ahhh thats why i used to not watch any tv ever i always thought it was too much dedication
sameeeeeeee
makes me feel in the loop
ahahahah the only person who probably consistently would make those references might be me ahahah
but its also a lot to actually get into it so i just dont do anything most the time
yeah it really takes a lot of time and effort
oh no ill just have to be confused each time then-
i think i brought up a couple of older references that had people dying
ok but that feeling is great
it's funny how i can't remember what i did yesterday, but i remember most everything from haikyuu
but my memory is too bad i cant actually name these things til it comes up
yeah!!! like i know a little too much about a bunch of discord bots
i still have 0 clue what that is
mainly moderation bots like mee6, tatsu, yagpdb, dyno but also some of the reaction role bots as well
idk what i ate for lunch but i can tell you so many random things
i turned on dev mode back in 9th grade and never turned it off
oh?
my friend was really annoyed by some kid and decided to try to get their ip from the discord account
who hasn’t tried to do that tho
but since they had a steam linked we actually did find the location :p
STALKER ALERT
dev mode is useful for a bunch of stuff
just be thankful yall weren't around in the skype era cause you could get someone's ip so easily 😭
my parents used to use skype to call relatives
ahaha same
i have a bad habit of googling too well
omg i wanna log in now bc i think i had old convos with some ppl i havent heard of in years
sometimes people ask me how i know things and i just say it was a search
it’s all on the internet yk???
y e a h
litearlly!
the internet will also tell you i'm smart and i understand cs
u seem smart
you have no idea
aerin is officially smart
it took me seven hours to understand what i was supposed to do in step 3 of lab 2
cant gaslight gatekeep girlboss out of this one aerin is certified smart
i don't even know what that means
i dont think i did it the right way
that is true josh
this is the one exception
but yeah, google makes me sound smart and accomplished cause i'm credited in some paper for cs
send paper
you won't find it
rip
:p
time to do some strange dev mode stuff to... find middle name?
no this is my middle name
your name is so cool either way tho!!
lmfao
i only realized this recently
lmao i do too
like my friend aera 😍 and the name mae
i didn't have a middle name until now
oh thats so cool
yeah!!!!
is it a new thing for college then?
yep
now im more curious 😩
also cause it lets me separate people i meet from relatives
wait thats why i asked my friend if she knew you earlier and she said she didnt LOL
wdym?
i just found it
i didn't title it
do you know annie lee btw from school
ohhhhhhhhhhh her
mm google
yeah no, the people from prospect knew me from my original name ahahahah
THAT PIC IS GORGEOUS
i-
her linkedin pic is so fire
i also haven't updated it cause lazyyyyy
Send it
and it's wayyyy too much work
The pic
i don't know why it pops up at the top
youre famousss
uh nooooooo
well i guess that doesnt relate to google becuase youre up there :o
lmfao
but i doubt i can make myself more social-\
yeah i told myself i'd actually try to be social
yay its so hard for me irl tho
i keep telling myself i'll run out of things to say, and then i don't because my midnight brain always comes up with something weird
oh night convos are the best
i actually liked irl social interactions, i could walk away
oh whattt i feel like walking away is easier online if you rly wanted to
nah i like physically walking away, i think it makes the message clearer
ok true uhhh ive gotten strange dms but i never reply unless i know them enough
i got messaged by some dude who i didn't know on snap and we were in the same ucsd group chat
for me my convos irl are usually w ppl i "know" so it feels too rude to just leave
and i got weird vibes
eek
and then turns out he was also messaging another friend of mine in the same gc
uhhh giant red flags!
then when i refused to give him my insta, he really stalked me and found me and shamelessly sent me a follow request
nice block
lmfaooooo
some ppl need to just
that makes me think of haikyuu
think? take a hint? be normaler?
i mean his insta was really weird too
hopefully i never encounter him
s a m e
why did i imagine you logging on to zoom i think my brain is frying
i honestly got really lonely and bored during the whole zoom life
ive never had to but i need to do smth about my health
s a me
30 sec of walking makes me tired already
oh i can tolerate walking for a long time
my heart rate is alrd kinda abnormal perhaps because i havent moved
there have been a number of occasions where my family has gotten lost so at this point i'm just like sure whatever
i think my walking is getting better lmao but i definitely gotta work on survival skills
ahahahahahahah
my health app was a good 100 steps daily average for the majority of each month and thats really not it
i feel like that's the same for me
oh my gosh that would be me because i imagine people with their pfps if i talk to them a lot online
i guess people get all shocked that i don't look like tendou satori
LMAO
it's also weird whenever people find my linkedin and the kinda know me and someone messages me with ur pretty
maybe i look like boba tbh a good percentage of me might be that anyways
ahahahahah
my linkedin is still not pfped oops
i don't know why i did but i did
Face
ahahah
ethan ill just expect you to look like that 24/7
oml trueeee
Of course, I am in a constant state of despair
y e s
:oo guess we'll see on zoom on monday
ahahahahahah
lol i dont think ive seen pics of ppl using references i actually know yet
i honestly found a bunch of zoom backgrounds
omg i finally got a laptop last month and i never had the option for legit zoom backgrounds so i havent used any yet
i keep playing with them
oh now i gotta pay attention to that :p
i also end up stretching a lot ahahha
:kitty:
my anxiety makes me hyper aware
oh nooo
nightmare moment right there
im more aware of my mic yeah i kinda check that its muted religiously
sameeeeeeeeee
hopefully 🤞
i get so anxious
usually i just make sure my camera is in an ok position then i dont wanna look at myself anymore tho
even if i'm just stretching cause sometimes i like to make faces
ahahahah i just sit and stare at the screen and i HOPE i didnt stretch strangely without realizign it
lmaoooo that's also a good way
tho i hate people looking at me, ill never know
i'm gonna miss being able to have a plushie on my table
aww just carry a small one with you to class hehe
lmaoooo i keep it on my desk
omg i wouldnt want to part with it :(
lmaooooo
but also bringing it to school  would might not turn out too well
although i swear i can't sleep without holding something like a plushie
at least you wont be as emotionally attached to a new one
i'm more concerned about the people who sleep like a log
i really dont know how anyone does that
pffft
ooo does it still work
it's a desk ornament, not a plushie really
it keeps you company through ~~boring~~ claaases
ahahahahahah
i wanna bring a squishy plushie in case i ever want to hug one because the mood is very random and not that often for me
honestly i find it so funny how i want to hug people when it's a pandemic
butfor me its random so its not like when i actually see ppl i wanna hug them -_-
honestly i don't mind being hugged but that's mainly because i had a few friends who just randomly hugged me
oh same now but only certain people
i think the only thing i'm usually like oh no is like being picked up physically
i couldnt name the conditions but sometimes im repulsed lmaoo
i've had people try to pick me up and it's weird as heckkkkkkkk
thats strange
i know
but normal picking up uhh nty
i also happen to have a number of tall friends
but not thattt tall
tall friends tend to have a thing for being like, let me help you experience what it's like to be way too far off the ground
i dont think any of my school friends are that tall lol
it's honestly really funny but a lot of the people i know just tower over me
and i mention it every time
honestly i swear it's because i'm short
just tall
ahahah
even if they might be 6 in apart
i keep track of people's heights mainly cause i need to know where i measure up to
im annoyed i shrank 3 times already
oh actually
ah ive heard of that
ahahahah
idk when i went back again i think i shrunk
supposedly i shrank a whole 0.5 inches
oh thats 2 shrinks not 3
buuuut when i measured at home, i was exactly 5'3
people are like... why are you using decimal points
riiiiight
ok i should keep measuring til i grow again uh maybe i was standing badly that day
ahahahah
Average for dudes is like 5 9 right
idk
I remember looking it up and finding out I was exactly average lol
ask another dude maybe they'd know
lol also avg by country (usa) or just overall
honestly no clue
yeah i remember 3 or 4 but i thought guys was like 8
tbh i don't mind being short, it's just kinda like argH when people bring it up
idk i dont care once theyre taller than me ahaha
okay but either way i still think 5'8 is tall
ok true i always justify why short>> tall
it's five inches over my head
i cant imagine a 5'8 person rn
i-
oh
i can sorta
youer more than a half a foot taler  !!
like i had a classmate in middle school who was 6'4 and i stood next to him
Middle school???
and it was interesting how short i felt
Shit bruh I would feel short too
yeah i was in 6th and he was in 7th
i cant imagine lol
ahahaha
I vaguely remember an extremely tall person at my middle school but not lynbrook
i always forget how tall people are but people at 6ft don't feel too tall to me
Funny story, there were like five Ethan lins total at lynbrook
are you sure, i thought he went there
Three of which were in my year
he would have been  a year above you
All three of us were in the same freshman pe class
my parents said that if i was a boy they would have called me ethan lmfao
One of us one of us one of us
ahahahah

i suddenly remembered something really stupid
ooh yeah him
i had a classmate who i shared the same set of initials with so the teacher asked who had a middle name and he did so he had to put the initial for his middle name as well
did you believe it lmaoo
no
2nd grade is just a strange year tho
he also got held back a year
oh-
like in kindergarten or something
My parents told my middle school that my middle name was S, so I expanded it to sanic
ahahah
did they just let you do that 😩
trueeee
oh sanic is gone
oop
is your middle name part of the system or does it just register as a nickname?
my parents really just gave me a list and said pick
so influential lmaoo
oh i had an official amendment
For the official documentation it was just S.
i mean all the names started with 'c'
wow what if they were quirky and made it "S." lmao dont people use symbols in names now 👀
guess they do?
exactly what i was thinking
honestly i already have a hard time thinking up names for pets, much less children
LOL me thats why my stuffed animals dont even have names
if anything i'm probably going to steal names from tolkein or dvergatal
i hope i never have to name someithng
well you might have to name variables and stuff
oh my gosh yeah those are hard enough
and then it turns into what in the actual world does any of this mean
i think one year when my teacher cared about essay names i woukd actaully get points off
so when people ask i smile and laugh
big brain
but for poems and stuff i just use whatever really random, abstract thing comes up in my brain first
sometimes i give up and im like "1984 essay"
ahahahah
i havent written a poem since 9th so havent thought about that!
i mean people tend to find deeper meanings in poems
oooh yes there are so many interpretations of things that werent even supposed to be things
and i just happen to remember the names of random artists and some of their works
(as you can see my word usage is great)
i learned some art history as a child
oh i know 0 abput art
it's honestly just part of the random stuff i happen to know
even tho i took classes before and we learned a bit of that
lmaooo i learned it when i was really young
i need to fix my memory
lmaooo
idk how tho lol my parents just say SLEEP
i don't know why i remember how to play blackjack so clearly
litearlly my mom questions why my memory is worse than hers and im at a loss for words
and sometimes when i google memory loss and i look at the specific kind  i might have
sketchy
ahahah
but same 😩
i've had people tell me i asked them the same question five or six times
same same or they say something i didnt know i told them and im like :surprised:
i also remember almost nothing about my childhood or even like more recent stuff
i barely have memories of the house i lived in til literally end of 5th grade
my worst anxiety is that i've said something bad and people remember
i just cant deal w it
ahahah worst part is that when i do briefly remember things
awh my brief memoreis usually end up in me intensely cringing at myself
and it's so ridiculous
just forget about those people who werent good for you !! easier said than done sometimes
the fact that there are only four of us online ahahah
yayy hopefully that keeps improving
i forget them
oh its 2:43?! what happened to the time
ahahah
but then it doesnt really matter anymore
i just like being wide awake at night
me too night is so much better
but i also have to wake up tomorrow to go outside and walk ;w;
o shoot i might need to wake up early as well im moving some stuff to sd
ahahahah
wait revelle is so far from me :(
i'm excited to hopefully get to stay up late more often at ucsd ahahah
i said i wanted to fix my sleep schedule but tbh it 99% wont happen especially if i get later classes
oh i have to fix it but no morning classes for me
im in erc
isn't erc past muir
its a few past muir lol
revelle was my second choice i think
erc was my 5th but now i wish i put it last LOL thought it didnt matter that much near the end
but i don't care cause there's the aquarium further down
i don't even know what choice revelle was for me aha
i just want to go to the aquarium sooooooo
there's a shuttle that runs between it and ucsd (at least pre covid)
that sounds fun
oo i dont actually know much about the campus so itll be fun to explore
my uncle was an alum from a long time ago and he told me i could get around just fine with a shuttle
yup, plus you get a free bus pass that works for like 95% of the lines in san diego
i just wanna run down to the aquarium
so you can get around super easily
everything else is not that interesting ahahah
oooh nice i hope the shuttles work
yeah i need to find people to stay up with either at my college
im scared ill just not even be able to make it to the cogsci building or wtv right now lmaoo
or just stay up with together online
i forgot what it said tho
i hope it's not in the warren area
cogsci is pretty close to geisel!
ohhhhhhhhhh that is going to be funnnnnnnn
(if you are looking at it top down)
i can get my exercise in ig :p
oh i was gonna say i think a lot of ppl study there so if needed i might just crash there lmaoo
i wish i actually found geisel interesting enough to remember the architect's name smh
i tell myself this is a good way to improve my health
some of the housing at ucla is done by john lautner
oh i dont know a single architect ever
i only remember around 10 names for architects at most
haha that's awesome
i probably know more renaissancce artists off the top of my head though
good for trivia yay!
my mom taught me art history and used to drill me
why art hsitory?
i think that's why i got into reading mirror text too and font names
sadly i forgot most the random info i used to know
i know a number of fonts by name
that’s so interesting
it's honestly very useless information
haven’t heard of anyone who does that
but presentations are so boring sometimes
LOL true gotta spice it up
lmaoooooo
i think i could only name times new roman and some strange fancy fonts i used to like a while back
ohhhhhhh those are pretty cool
i hateeee timse new roman but that might just be because i hate writing essays lolol
i usually just use some kind of sans serif or serif font
same
i honestly just keep one original copy of the formatting and fill everything else in
i think i used to use comic sans unironically but we don’t speak about that anymore
i honestly find essays and english the easiest of all classes
i did that too on my old school account but that’s deleted now agh i should’ve changed it
and i think my teacher hated me for loving timed essays
i don’t agree with you uhhh do you wanna take mmw for me LMAO
well he didn't actually hate me
oh my that’s more work for the teacher tho
yeahh
reminds me of how ppl would say to just ramble on act essay and you’d do well
i'm just really quick to make thing sup
LOL
i thought the essay was the easiest part of the standardized test
ripp sometimes it’s easier without the higher level knowledge tho because i think it only went to geo or alg
honestly that is so fair
reminds me of how i tried tot tutor a 6th grader in a class i never took bc i skipped it... they were learning smth SO USELESS i didn’t know how to do it aidkskckdkcd
then a semester later i had to drop calc bc because it was like gibberish to me
you did great!
ahahahah
precancerous
i was lucky my professor took out the part of the final on integrals since everyone bombed that part
xDDDDD
ahahah
i agree i forgot how it even works
i only like derivatives
derivatives are easier and you don’t have to +c it
i just got to use my calculator and not show most of my work
calc b is a worse jump than calc c tho (imo) so it doesn't scale up forever
i literally took ab and bc back to back in semesters and still forgot integrals
you probably will have to do calc c as well but it's not as bad as calc b imo
lmao i have most of my ges done so i can't put it off much longer to begin with lmaoooo
it's not too bad imo
oh that is going to be fun in the most painful way possible
"do this thing you alreayd know how to do, but do it twice instead"
that is actually kinda nice
yah its definitely not as hard of a jump as b is lolol
b is not a jump
there is some other stuff that's new too ofc but it's definitely not the worst thing in the world
it's fine though, i think my current existing college gpa can carry me even if i mess up two math classes
ya plus you might be able to take some stuff p/np as well (can't remember if math is able to be) so that's always an option
whenever i see p/np i think of that millenium problem
which problem?
it's one of those very difficult to solve math problems that has like a huge reward if you can get the correct solution
OH THAT P/NP
i want to say that one of them did get solved but i also might have remembered wrong
i’ve never heard of it i just searched it up lmao
i know they mentioned p/np but not the actual problem itself
sounds like another last name
trachtenberg is a last name
my brain forgets sooo many words it makes me so annoyed during timed essays because i can’t think about what that random common word is
i am usually that one student who is technically done but keeps writing anyway
that word sounds strangely familiar
i know i have a large vocabulary
it's the fear of long words xD
and i really like learning those random words from tumblr that are so rarely used
i think i used to do that
the only time those tumblr words ever come into use is when yet another person titles a fanfic using one of those
i’m surprised i actually remembered one of the strange words i learned
i learned words like gracile
doesn’t even sound english tbh
i still don't know how i got an a in that class
lolll i like randomly throwing in chem bc that class actually interested me
and my chem 1a was carried by huge extra credit
wow
and people always look at me funny for it
i would probably tbh LOL
not that i find it important how they feel lmfao
you just seem like a metalloid today
i'll just be like "noble gas personality type" out of the blue
wait i could see the noble gas tho
i think the weirdest thing i've ever done was try to convert all my writing into old english runes
oh i really can’t deal w old english
old english and old english runes are different
OH
yeah
i just searched it ok
i mean before that i wanted to write mirror script but being left handed, i technically could have done that to start
gives me hieroglyph vibes
yeah it really does
have you practiced mirror script at all?
so i can kinda write with my right hand
oo elvish looks mystical
i mean i usually don't but i can do it alright
ahahah i used to practice my left
i can read mirrored text just fine
there were a few stages where i literally would use my left in school but then i started to need to write fast and that didn’t work
not that well
i’ve never tried because i just can’t draw at all with anything LOL
the only thing i can consistently draw are cats
i need to learn how to draw cute animals
i learned cursive and now i mix my print and cursive
like just stick figure version
it looks confusing as heck though reading my notes
i guess some of my writing is cursive because of how it connects but i usually don’t write things like the cursive s anymore
i also don't dot my i's anymore sooooooooo
many times when i write my names i don’t write 2 n’s properly
ahahahah i write things down by hand
i just have some lumpy scribbled
i tend to forget otherwise
ah i like typing bc i’ll forget anyways LOL
honestly i just realized
hmm
i just take in input, create an output
LOL
it actually explains why i have no clue what i've turned in for the most part
Won’t comment on that bc i don’t wanna say some strange incorrect code thing in a cs server 😩
ahahah i made my brother so frustrated
o m g do you just turn in assignments or tests and completely forget the topic or prompt
and then he was like wth
i tried to ask my sis but i forgot she knows nothing 😭
ahahah
ikr people ask what i wrote about and i’m like ... what did we even do
i literally just try to think of the easiest way to solve the problem so i can write almost zero code
i wanna write less but my brain doenst process til after i do smth rly convoluted lmao
ahhhhhh same
oo theater fun fun those classes scare me tho
they give me so much anxiety
if i do speak i’ll overspeak
technically i guess i can act, i'm good with expressions
but a lot of times i just don’t speak at all lol
ahahah
oo i just know i did one acting thing as a child and i laugh sm when i watch now and wonder what the heck happened to me
i used to do musicals so theoretically i should be okay with like idk stages?
oh i didn’t get to go today :( how was it? forogt to ask someone about it
it took a long time
i used to have the worst stage fright (probably still do)
and i just read whatever i wrote while panicking
aw that’s nice i would probably not wanna speak up tho lmao
the deer in the headlights
ajejdkskckdkck
i swear things were easier when we were kids
everything was easier then
it really wassss
but i cannot comprehend
honestly i was thinking back to the musicals i did
i don’t rly know musicals well but i guess many were made back in the day where it was normal to be misogynistic
trueeeee
i think a few years ago i wanted to try to do a musical but obviously my stage fright completely killed that
awwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
oo do your parents watch a lot
no not really
my first (and only i think) was phantom
my dad just had them and i was introduced to them early
oh those are all cute throwbacks now
i think the last muscial i saw was carrie
oh wait i saw hamilton last year but it was from home so idk if that counts lol
ohhh hamilton is fun
oh that one sounds familiar i think my school did it and my friend was a part of it
did you ever have a gymnastics phase?
omg i did gymnastics in prek i think lmao
ahahah sameeeeeeeeeee
started dance around that time tho and that was what i stuck with but i did have a few phases throughout where i wanted to do gymnastics things
i swear everyone did back in those days
i’m WEAK
i did ballet i think idk
i don’t like water tbh i can’t even breathe easily when i’m standing in a pool lolll
ohhh
oh yes i used to do that but my arms would give out too soon hehe
i honestly went through trial and error to do it
oh sports not my thing but tbh basketball was an ok unit in pe loll
i can't say if sports were really my thing
tho i’ve barely scored any baskets in my life
i just did them
yeah i can’t do that either but ehhh whatwver LOL
i just didn't like doing offensive stuff
not gonna play bball in the future or anything
honestly if i actually focused on cross country, my stamina would probably be better smh
ahhhh yeah
i don't even know how i convinced myself to run 2 miles
once an xc friend tricked me into running 3 MILES i thought i was gonna die
and the worst part was i had a friend who was shouting at me to run faster ahahah
1 is my max bc it’s required in pe smh
honestly 1 mile is so nice
oh no that pressure when you’re alrd dying trying to pace yourself
pfft i would actually slow down
good solution 😌
oml the 400 m as a track event is so hardddddddddd
AGREED
i still remember doing training
i literally never did it before but my first meet, they signed everyone up for the 400
i'd have to do those weird things where you sprint 50 m and walk 50 m or something and go up by increments of 50 or something
i basically died
i ran a 3200 once
ohh yeah i think we did that
it was horrid
disgusting n
i did pretty good in 400
i did horrendous in literally everything but jumps and hurdles
honestly lining up gives me anxiety
and the gun scared me lol i have slow reflexes too
oh yeah, track definitely is like RUN RUN RUN
i joined with friends who also just wanted to do jumping events but they quit i forgot why
i used to just watch people get smoked
and i was left there not realizing jumping is for sprinters who only run during practice and have to stay extra to do other stuff lmao
like one of the soccer players was in track and he would outsprint practically everyone in the 100m
ok but it’s sometimes interesting to wat h fast ppl
i find it hilarious
like i could never dream of moving at that speed it looks so strange
ahahah
uhhh
like it's almost 4 am
it’s been an hr since i pointed out the time????
yes
ok yeah let’s sleep
because it's fun
i wonder if anyone is gonna even try to scroll and read tmrw LOL
but i also need to zip it and sleep before i wake up tomorrow and bask in my regret like i did this morning
they’ll learn a lot about us without us knowing!!
it's fine
oh yes i regret my choices a little bit every morning but not enough to change my habits
because i'll probably start another long convo tomorrow :3
yay funn
ahahahahahah
mhm mhm :)
i also have stuff to do tomorrow like looking at my classes i need for graduating in a few years lmao
oh i tried to do that before but i won’t think about that rn lmaoo GOOD NOGHT!
good nightttttttttttttt :3
good morning :)
i-
yes i am girlbossing today
hi alexxxxxxxxx
hi aerinnnnn
last night we had a pet picture thing for a bit lmao
i love that
yeah & someone suggested an actual channel for pet pictures :3
There is now a new #pet-pictures channel!
yayyyyy
lets goooo
how’s everyone doing so far today? :3
i can't unread it
i was going to just not wake up early but my mom was like we *have* to go outside and walk sooo i got dragged outside
i literally read it that way before seeing your message too 😭
that’s hilarious
though i do wonder what type of ads i would get
i don’t do anything in spanish at all lmao
ah sounds like chinese the first time we had to write essays too
lmaooo idk how the ad algorithms work either
also i’m on the car and getting kinda carsick so ttyl lmao
okayyy lmao
and i’m not carsick anymore i got my boba fix !!!
awwwww good luck alexxxxx
i got jasmine mt and my sister got regular so basically both hehe
lmaoooo that’s great!!!
oh yeah i just visited ucsd for a bit and i’m estimating that it’ll take me around 20 min to get to geisel/cogsci building every day 😭 i’m actually so tired from just walking around a bit LMAO
aaaaaaaaa that sounds p long for a walk
this school will def improve my stamina lmaoo and my daily steps
fr fr!!! i swear i get more exercise when school is in-person
definitely lol my parents usually can’t even get me to open the door to get some light
lmaooo
it really is... i know it’s good for me and all that but
my parents are like wear a mask, wipe your hands every time you get back to the car, wash them when you get home, wipe everything you buy
oh 😭 i started taking d3 pills ever since i went to the doc a few weeks ago LOL
i was supposed to start taking them way back in 6th grade after i went to my doctor about wrist pain
tbh i should take all the vitamins uhh i think i’m deficient in everything healthy
well she prescribed painkillers that didn’t work soooooo i guess that was why she thought that?
sounds so funnn i’ve never been prescribed anything long term before
i have no idea honestly
i keep stopping myself from taking it even though multiple people have told me to lol
my parents bought it for me after a psychiatrist said to i think, or something
oh yeah that’s true it can stop your sleep from getting worse and worse and worse
which is exactly what i need to do today
i guess i’m saving it for when i really need it so that it’ll actually work on me lolll
i went out, came home and napped soooo i just woke up a few minutes agoo
oh love that i took a short nap in the car earlier
i knew someone who took a bunch of high dosage melatonin and at some point it just stopped working
i also don’t wanna be reliant on it so i assume it’ll be a once in a while thing (but idk i have no idea how it’s like so i don’t wanna get addicted LOL)
oh it’s weird as heck when it kicks in
oh wow
but it’s not like it instantly kicks in
all i remember is that once i was sick and i took nyquil to help slepe and instead i woke up like 1-2 hrs later and got even more sick smh
ahhhhh being sick sucksssss
ah it’s like a delayed thing
another reason why i don’t go outside
i didn’t have those 3 months of sneezing
i really skipped getting sick all of my senior year and i was soooo happy
also eek gtg to a fancy work dinner thing i hate these i feel so out of place
good luckkkkkkkkk
and the food is fancy but im a simple gal so i’ll just sit here being antisocial on my phone lmaoo
yayyyyyyy jennyyyyy
i started but i procrastinated
i'm telling myself i have to get it done
i don’t even count doing a small-ish assignment the day before procrastinating tho LOL especially since i’ve kinda looked at it and thought about it
i procrastinated on a whap shower curtain and ended up ruining a decent jacket over it
and star wars? that seems so strange in whap lmaoo i didn’t take that class but my friends only had boring old history stuff
did no one else take whap and have to do a giant shower curtain?
uh maybe but i’ve never heard a word about it and it sounds so out of place 😩
honestly though i can understand star wars being unique
lmaoo maybe it’s a more common thing but it just sounds so strange
and then i kinda procrastinated until like 11 pm and stayed up until 5 am doing the project and at some point i absentmindedly messed up and one of my sleeves turned pitch black and my arm got stained too
oh no omg sharpies are impossible
yeah and the jacket was my basketball one :p
aww
thank goodness my season was over or i'd have to explain the giant black stain of sharpie that wouldn't come out
they all remind us not to but we still do hehe
riiiiiight?
also i convinced my mom to let me leave :)))) she had no objection tho she didnt wanna be there either
that's niceeeee :3
oopsies
i have a trick for that
i used to submit a lot of stuff at 6-7 so they might just think i woke up early 😌
ahahahah
sometimes i try to start early but i know it takes me a lot longer if i dont have the deadline in front of my face lmao
that's why i liked timed essays so muchhhhhhhhhh
yeah i think they all got used to it
i seriously can't think of anything to write when i'm trying to write an essay early usually
IKR
i have an unimaginable amount of run on sentences
like my long blocks of msgs that have 0 punctuation
oml i try not to let my sentences get too long
*try is the key word for me but i usually fail lolll
but i got into a bad habit of writing exceedingly long sentences with no real idea of when i should stop the sentence
yeah! and its also strange to separate into short sentences sometimes
i used to get in so much trouble for having like 10 different run ons
i definitely had comments about that lol
i don't get how anyone writes essays without run ons
yeah sometimes the ideas come while youre writing and it all relates so i wanna keep it in one sentence! but some ppl just know what theyre saying beforehand so it sounds good lol
that is so true
oo do you do creative writing
yessssssss
woooo im definitely not creative enough to write so nopee
lmao do you have any other hobbies? :3
im kinda boring i dont do anything anymore
oml i could neverrrrrrrrrrr
i used to dance and sing hehe but since quarantine i havent rly done either
ohhhhhhh that's so cool
i would sit around bored thinking of things to do but not actually doing it... then 2021 started and i finally started watching shows to pass time but thats not rly productive
or maybe i just don't remember which college correctly ahahah
i also am too scared of people to sing in front of others LOL
i think i've only ever written 150 ish pages
thats still crazy
but i have hit 200 pages compiling recipes i found interesting
ingredient lists can take up a lot of space lmao
honestly, i don't know how to cook, i just follow the instructions
or anime
ahahah cdramas
not me watching in 2x speed for everything ever tho
my parents used to have me watch those taiwanese tv shows and ahklajdfks
:o i never watched but theyd run in the background lmao
i would just be like "HURRY UP AND GET TOGETHER, IT'S SO OBVIOUS YOU TWO WILL DATE"
AHAHAHA most romcoms are all the same and cliche now
fr fr
or can i
n o
eh i should probably be more socially involved instead of watching something i dont even feel like watching sometimes 😩 litearlly some shows were for the sake of wasting a day away
i felt that
oh yeah do you think youre gonna join any clubs?
honestly i have no idea
felt that so hard
i mean there are so manyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
ikr ! seems overwhelming tbh
it's like high school clubs x 100 i swear
ikr i tried to go to some but i went once and dipped oops-
let's be real, i didn't join any clubs in high school
mhm unless you were an owner or had a position AND it was actually somewhat influential
my honors bio teacher had an anime club that i occasionally crashed
:oo oh no what happeend
so this kid was a freshman in my chem honors class cause he apparently took a bio class at harker summer before school started and he made a science club which he claimed would be amazing
not the horror i was expecting but still horror nevertheless 🥴
and the most "fun" thing he did was a project where people made ovens out of old pizza boxes and tinfoil which is something you can do as a child
wow you actually kept going to the club after finding out what it was about??
nope
welppp not really a surprise ig
apparently the club is still around
oh ! did they improve at all
that i don't know
o hey thats pretty impressive
i think the only other club i can remember being relatively remarkable was the math & physics tutoring club
do you even remember those things :')))
oml thoseeee
forgot the name tho
oml rainbow loom?
oh yes i make typos all the time if you havent noticed heheh
the only really interesting that happened during my elementary school days was i had a bunch of overnight trips starting in 3rd grade
we used to go hiking a lot tho and i think rancho san antonio has a farm if you know what that is
i just remember my overnight trips cause i had two each year including my 6th grade
ooo nice i think i had overnight for science camp
i actually kinda know where that is
and i also had school retreats so those were overnight
i used to have beach trips for three years straight
oh yeah beach is fun on warm days
omg i hate camping for that same reason
yuck
and i saw a banana slug and screamed
omg people used to lick those things
and kiss them
its so nasty
and there were also creeks and people would really play in them even though there were water skeeters on the water
YUCK
my hatred for banana slugs is exactly why i couldn't attend ucsc ahahah
love that we're :ucsd_triton:
yesssssssssssssssssssssssss
baically a fork
yesssssssss
not scary 😌
i just realized my two high school friends who are at ucs are bears
slug bruin thats all i know
ucla is also a bear
i didnt even realize lmaoo
and then ucsb is a black big cat who wears a funny hat i think
the mascots are all slightly strange except for berk i think
uci is anteater
oh right i got a lot of emails about becoming an anteater lmao
lmaooooo
ooo nice i know someone at la who said we should meet up in the middle sometime :))
ahahahah my friend who's going to u of t moved away to seattle and there's a cat cafe there
omg i love cat cafes i wanna go
honestly toronto is super farrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
literally the opposite side of the country but further up :(
honestly  i don't know my geography too well
my geo sucks too
cause i promised i'd visit them sometime cause i wanna try poutine
but i have a friend in quebec and i know toronto is next to there lmao
that's super coollllllllllll
mhm well shes an online friend but still hehe i doubt we'll ever meet
i have a bunch
yeahhh that happens for me with so many people and i dont even know why it always ends up being that way
time zones really mess things up though
oo nice :)) it always sucks to drift away
fr f r
i basically live in taiwan timezone a lot of the time during summer LOL thats the excuse i use when my parents find me awake when they wake up
my mom always tells me my time is upside down in chinese
ahahah just gettin ready to go on vacay to asia :))
oml yesssssssssssss
YES SAME
honestly now i have an actual reason to be up at odd hours since some of my friends from my guild like haikyuu and they're in a diff timezone
but it would be so hard to figure out stuff especially if i got lost or something lol
fr fr
timezones are always so annyoing but also a good excuse :)
y e s
have you picked up any japanese from animes?
i picked up more japanese from the japanese medical tv show i watch than i do from animes, oddly enough
oh i think reality/variety shows are usually better for learning because people speak more casually
definitely
oh rly?
like the miya twins speak in i think the kansai dialect
oh what show? i think i only know produce c ampfor k-tv shows
although i knew how to say good morning cause i had a teacher in elementary school who liked to have people do good mornings in different languages so everyone learned something new ig
never heard of that show lol but its always amazing to find something so random that you end up loving
yesssssssssssss
like i was this close to having that never be a part of my life but nopee
lmaooooooo
yesshhs and yay more ruined sleep LOL
i remember i had this phase where i thought premed and neurosurgery was so cool
oh nopee :( never heard of it is it good?
honestly i really enjoyed it
i havent read in too long so i used to only read those classic fiction ya books or smth
i'm probably going to rewatch it when i'm at ucsd lmao
i just searched it and i saw agoraphobic and that word just = corpse in my brain 😩 LOL
ahhhhhhh sameeee
but rip ill be driving back to the bay
i'm honestly excited because i was at his first twitch which happened last month
i only found out that he started on twitch literally last week but im really out of the loop now and streams take so long to watch so 😭
yeah they really do
ah yes the horror game lol
some of them are soooo long
basically hapepend all of december which was LITERALLY COLLEGE APP SEASON
oml college app season ahahahahahahahah
i really didnt start common app til 2021
i honestly just read manga instead of writing my supps
ah that was me with streams lol
omllllllllll that's wild
i didnt think enough about college to care too much about apps and thats why on the day the uc was due, i was frantically looking for any major to put in lol
ahahah my mom is the one who handles the questions
i had no clue what i was doing myself
i read so many  fanfics that i know what bad storytelling sounds like
oh i used to read fanfics i had a phase but many just had horrendous grammar
i spent my last year of high school reading manga and fanfics
the only thing i can ado is grammar lol not the actual content
i think it depends on the fandom really, the quality is all over the place
true true
content is the only thing i can actually help with
also some are written by literal kids who dont know what theyre doign and its kinda cringe lmao
yessssssssssss
content is more important tho like you could alwasy get grammarly to check grammar but not content lol
usually you can tell how experienced an author is from the way they summarize, tag and other stuff
oh yeah
the ones who write on tumblr as well as ao3 tend to have better content from what i've noticed
oh i litearlly havent been on tumblr i dont get how it works
honestly i have seen some decent all lowercase fics
i think it got really annoying to use
i mean they don't
true i think ive read some but it really depends on how they summarize or how the first part is
yessssssssssssssss
shoot forgot i was gonna work on aps LOL i think im gonna go do that rn :')
oml sameeeeeeee
so hopefully it isnt too bad but
i mean
ok true im very glad it isnt because tbh my descriptions sound very wonky and nonacademic LOL
ngl i'm approaching it the same way i approach essays
is anyone else here :((((
yeah!!! is anyone else here??? ;w;
i have it but my laptop cant open it and i wanted to use it as reference:/
did you mean the aps discussion yesterday? if so i didn't download any files, i just wrote down what was relevant to the questions and that was it lmao
ahh i remember he sent whatever he wrote on the whiteboard in chat but the file type (1a) is so strange
yeah sometimes you end up needing some weird thing to open files
mhm i usually would screenshot but i forgot to figure out how to do this on my new laptop 🤡
the only stuff i have written down is that chart he drew of the 33 coin problem
yeah i just got this lpaotp too and im used to mac controls since our school laptops were macbooks
yeah the windows computers have this built in screenshotter known as snipping tool
i opened it so its all good :) ty tho lmao
okayyyyyyyyyyyy that's goodddd :3
mhm but now since ive forgotten math, i forgot how to write functions :')
functions like math functions
oh yeah i mean math functions right now like how we need to write an equation as a function of *n* lmao
do we actually?
like parts 1e and 2e lmao i might be overthinking it tho
okay i just looked at the 1a chart
ahh sorry i was "working" on aps and got distracted lmao
nooooo it's all gooddddddddddd
o yes :)) i think you were listening to greatest showman atm
dw about it too much
yesss the soundtrack is also so good
i know
about artists uhhh recently i havent been listening to english songs LMAO but i think i usually prefer ppl like ed sheeran lewis capaldi dean lewis etc etc those tpyes of songs... but i also have some strange tastes that dont match that at all
lewis capaldi
omg i can spend hrs trying to sort playlists and stuff
also i felt that so hard
LOL YES angsty songs are nice to make me feel a certain mood idk how to explain it
he was on yesterday and he kept saying he was gonna release these two songs from the film but he never did
i used to be obssede w him
i just really liked those two songs in particular lmao
oo ill go listen to them then
they're only on yt tho
i think the only unreleased songs i can think of are miss you and something about cutting your hair idr 😩
but i only really keep up with corpse at this point lmfao
ahhhh yeah sometimes i download local files but theyre all gone now since new laptop
man new laptops are such a pain
i see i see but tbh many corpse songs are too intense for me
so glad my dad loaded all the important stuff of mine onto a hardrive
fr!! but my school one was basically dead
that is so fairrrrrrrrrrr
:oo i was too lazy to do that
lmao
mhm i rly like his voice but now i usually like softer songs
although he does have new stuff coming sometime
yeahhh ive listened to that one a few  times
soft songs are so niceeeee
oo ok i like taking a listen in case theres smth i can vibe w lol
i think i found most of my soft songs from one of those remix youtube channels
yes yes i think i realizd my fav genre is something i made up but wtv i call it melancholic ballads LOL
lmao ballads
omg k/da lol
okay but if you're into like bass singers
yeah i think my taste is kinda random bc i do kinda listen all over the place
not like corpse deep
:o who?
colm mcguinness?
but i dont usually find new music on youtube
i got a little too into sea shanties cause i was listening to reinaery
omg i just searched it and drunken sailor is such a throwback that song makes me laugh
i swear that song reminds me of my 6th grade days
im prety sure i sang that song in choir in elem school or smth LMAO we were all like what the heck
omg i was in choir in elementary school tooooooooooooooooooooo
:o which choir lmao was it asian
nah it was school choir lmfao
wait yeah so many elem school things were BEFORE school which is so </3
and we sang the christmas in whoville thing though i think we messed that one up a bunch during practice
parents probably made me
ahahahah
oo fun
omg i knew about 1D only cause we had to sing one of their songs and the daughter of the mom in charge of choir loved the band ig
thats kinda funny lmaoo choir singing 1D would normally seems trange
we sang it during springtime or something
NA NAN AN AN ANANAN
ahahahahahahahahah
my friend literally wrote a whole parody of that song but unfortualnyely i forgot all the lyrics
i swear things were so simple back then
yes yes just everyting before hs tbh
honestly y e s
ppl talking about how hs actually matters :S
high school's proper synonyms are pain and stress ahahah
and also bad admin :')
y e s
ig technically the day before yesterday
yeah technicallyyyy but also technicalities are kinda eh
ugh idek how to word that
honestly
me too and people are like... no you sleep in the morning
n o
LOL TRUE
jenny did you got to a public school or a private school?
oh i went to priv starting in 6th
oh wow that's pretty cool!!!
tbh i just say tuition isnt worth but im not mad my family sent me there lol
i think it really depends on the school tbh
the admin did many questionable things tbh but its not like publics were better
that's also a good point
so many ppl in our school hated it tho because i went to a chrisitan school and many staff are old white males who lean very right
ohhhhhhhhhhhh
ah yeah i think the biggest thing is evolution
yeah evolution is controversial, don't some states refuse to teach it?
i know some teachers are like you better have my opinion or else you fail
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh i felt that
yeahhh those teachers are irritating
i think i pissed off my 9th grade advisory teacher that way lmfao
oop
i don't feel sorry at all though
i dont actually know what advisory teachers do but he probably deserved it 😩
he was just supposed to help us get oriented during the first month of school
oh lmaoo did he not experience people who disagreed w him before or smth
well
yes go tel him the facts and i love that he just disappeared afaeirgg
ahahahahah he didn't disappear
ahahaha i feel like if you had him as a teacher he would just feel awkward seeing you
lmfao it's one of the few times when i regret nothing
mhm definitely i also just cringe hearing people give advice like that in the first place and i wish i could retort half the time
sometimes i do it without thinking
i only have smart retorts if its w ppl im already pretty close with bc otherwise i probably wouldnt be talking
it takes so long to think of good ones
lol i bet the other ppl there were glad you said that
perhaps lmfao
oh definitely lol
i feel like since it takes so long to come up with retorts, i usually just end up saying exactly what i'm thinking
oh i cant relate but sometimes i wish i did that lmaoo
i felt that
i think the few times i *tried* to say what i was thinking just ended up so awkward and i just wanna go hide in a hole
there are times i strongly regret not saying something and being like "ur wrong"
gotta work on talking tbh
i love making portmanteaus
eh the meaning comes through anyways :))
talking is so hard sometimes i swearrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
OH YEAH
omg speaking typos
ahahahah i was trying to make a portmanteau w it but nothing sounds right
sometimes that happens
@jennosaur♡ @ragdoll kitten Hey guys, we're really glad that you're connecting, but maybe please move this convo to the dm's b/c it seems like it's been going on a while between just you too
omg i remember making portmanteaus of names too sometimes
people feel free to join in tho it makes things much more fun :D
yeah we had a fun group yesterday ;w;
42 days to go
that sounds so far away
ucsd supremacy
quarter system does weird things like that
quarter system inferiority 😔
quarter system is going to be kinda weird for me
it's DEFINITELY a lot sometimes but for me it's super nice because i like being able to move through things and it always feels like there's something new to do, which is especially nice for those GEs that are annoying
anyone have recs for good artists to listen to? i kinda wanna expand my horizons after corpse's b-day stream is over lmao
mgk has some newer bangers
oml mgk!!!!! :3
grandson if you like indie rock!
i actually heard grandson on a mike shinoda track once, it was pretty great

Yes yes sing

Perfection

that would be chaos but the fun kind
In choir we would do that for every birthday
pffft i don't think my family cares what i do anymore
Please protect your chords
wdym lmao
Pain == bad
i don't do it often :3
o gosh i like speaking strangely sometimes but its never too intense lol
sometimes my voice gets all growly for no reason lmao
As long as it doesn’t hurt or feel like there is a hole in your throat
and then i just make it a thing for the rest of the day
And don’t squish your vocal chords just let them be light and nice
i can't tell if i squish them or not lmao
ah yeah sometimes i get concerned hearing overly raspy voices
i can shift where it's getting growly now so i probably won't run into issues
And if it hurts you stop drink warm water with ginger and honey and lemon
i knowwww
Good good
i remember watching the gollum segment with andy serkis
XD
he said he did the gollum voice so much his voice was gone and they called it his gollum juice
You don’t wanna do that >:O
plus we'll both be at revelle lmaooooo
High pitch demon is just as terrifying as bass boosted demon
my voice can't go bass though lmfao
Sometimes more so if you add a scary cackle
ohhh that is so true
Mhm mhm
i bet it would have been hilarious if i used that voice in a haunted house at random
I do it when I wanna be spooky
SAMMMMMMMMMM
Of course
ahhhhh we should do it together sometime ahahh
Do you do accents too?
n o p e
We should do tongue twister games
i do animal noises though
John would probably rock it
i caused a group of dogs to howl once
I can’t do animals
i can kinda do them
I can do accents though >:D
which ones?
It depends sometimes but I’ve done Russian, Spanish, Australian, and English.
that is sooo cool
English and Spanish are easiest XD
what language did you take in school?
I took Spanish
oml sameeee
But I sing in Italian, French, German, Latin, Russian, Spanish, English, and other ones
that is super cool
https://tenor.com/view/anime-in-love-hearts-gif-10932413

I can drive every kind of car basically cause I learned how to drive the minivan. So I know how to do big and small cars
zoe knows how to drive, zoe is cool
And I’m responsible so you know… I could like take you to the beach or something
i can barely drive at 0 mph in a tiny corolla
I’ve driven people to Disneyland to celebrate graduation and stuff ? And like long drives I’ll switch with my mom to help out.
oml DISNEYYYYYYYYYYYY
thats so fun
i don't even know where the bumper is when i'm behind the wheel and my parents were just like "but ur just supposed to *know*"
That’s so dangerous
my brother really roasted me for mixing them
Like you just gotta know
like i wasn't behind the wheel but i guessed wrong :p
only in an empty parking lot once and sometimes around where i live when theres no one
so i've heard
I have to parallel park sometimes and every time I’m like please kill me
ohhhhhhhhhh berkeley
LOL
SF IS NIGHTMARE PARKING ZONE
And die
i always get so anxious when my dad's like trying to park
wait where in the bay are y’all
san jose
sf is a nightmare so we just use the caltrain
i have a friend going to berkeley
im next to great america
WOW
bart n all of the buses <33333
wait jenny i kinda know where you are lmao
yeahh i realize that using great america/levis stadium is a lot easier than saying the city LOL
we couldddd but would we?
EVIL FRIENDSHIP
lmaoooo
Mwahahaha
but if we do a big discord hangout then more people could joinnn
we love access
and no one would have to leave the house
exactly
me who had huge ulterior motives
Fair enough
i've been getting freckles from just standing outside for five seconds
Vitamin d deficient gang?
n o
but then got food
OMG YESSSS ZOE YES
XD
i have to take a giant pill bottle
i love food

Doctor always tells me to take vitamins and I forget every morning
ME
@John._. I humble-y ask you to describe UCSD food
is he even on though lmao
ohh yes
the only feature of ucsd i know of is the aquarium about a mile south of revelle
XD
and then off campus there's a tidepool like 5 miles away
lmao yea valley fair
everything else, i'm just going to wander around until i find it
but is the campus boba any good
oh right, there's supposed to be a target somewhere according to my mom
yes!!! target is near center of campus/geisel/price center
at the very worst, if the boba sucks, we could always buy the boba from ranch 99 and make the tea
Maybe in a pinch it would be good
lmao
since we cannot have cars
WE REALLY SHOULD
Me
ahahahah
whatt ive never heard anyone do that lol
buses and shuttles
apparently there's a decent italian cafe thing across the road from seventh that takes dining dollars
i remember that ucla had a billion of them lying around
pizza <3
did any of your parents tell you about the freshman 15?
I just throw vegetables on it
zoe that sounds funnnnnnnnnnnnn
But it’s customizable
we gotta hang out lots at revelle zoe!!! :3
We can have pizza on fridays or something
SURE :3
i want in
my parents keep being like watch you gain 50 instead of 15
oh gosh yeah freshman 15 scares me ahahah
YES EXERCISE
we still need to go to ethan’s dorm and have zoe teach us how to make pizza
i know how to make those packaged japanese curries
and lasagna
and i can follow recipes
And CHIMICHANGAS
and i have a bunch of recipes i took from cookbooks and stuff
Ooh and chik pea curry
so i can *technically* cook
i fucking love curry
l
It’s so relaxing
i applied for a single apartment

i wanna bake cookies
What kind of cookies??
i used to be such a mystery to my old classmates
LOL
p much no one knew a thing about me until like now???
wait zoe sam do you guys know each other irl
my bokuto switch got flipped
We went to high school together
that is so niceeee
oooh
i don't talk to the other people who went to high school with me lmao
Sam and I did senior sunrise together
i skipped mine
And we took pictures!
but that sounds hella cutee
i didnt even have a senior sunrise rip
my hs did but i also was like nah

oooh cuteeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
CUTE!!
ahahahah i saw a sunrise from trying out an all nighter for fun
but i have mild trauma associated to it so i pretend it does not exist
zoe your hoodie is cuteeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
we did get free boba and a blanket tho so that was cool
i block all memories of the single high school homecoming i attended
they gave us gamer lookin headsets for a silent disco at ours
and it had a funny black tea taste
i cant remember anything from the one hoco i attended so i wonder if there was some trauma i literallyforgot about
it was that basic looking brown one like the emoji
that is terrifying
okay but why not the ones with cat ears
i only knew silent headphones existed this year at our formal thingy lol
also me: has done the same halloween costume countless times

okay but would trick or treating be something college students do
Was fun!
i skipped all the social events for my 11th and 12th grade for good reason lmao
mm covid
i doubt it, i had a pseudo stalker at the school events
Oh. Police?
ohhh that's nice
Body guard?
nah there were other people who reported the dude and nothing happened
oh its that frkn guy ugh
yeah lmao
I liked seeing you!
my school did proms, but they were like at golf courses or something
@ragdoll kitten I suggest restraining order if he ever does that again
also anyone else who's online and looking at this chat! don't be a stranger!!!!!
Lol they’re like GO TO BED
and he's probably going to stalk all the poor girls at bus stops
I updated my pins
ohhh cuteee
Because I got San Diego safari park pins
WAIT
He’s sideways
i collected pins a long time ago
waittt i went to the san diego safari a few days ago lmaoo
omg baymaxxxxxxxxx
That’s one of two! I have the other to my best friend let me find a photo.
i heard there was lemur poop coffee
should i know what elephant poo paper is-
i think i've heard of it

OMG
But giraffes are my favorite
i had a floriography phase so i definitely have uselessly weird knowledge
I volunteered at the San Diego Safari Park XD
lmao giraffes, sorry there was gartic phone earlier today with giraffes on a stream lmao
Yeee
that is super cool!!!!!!!!
Lol
lmaooo i know some human anatomy facts, symbolism and like other useless things
Giraffes’ fun fact of the day is for every inch on their tongue that’s a foot in height
that is cooooooooool
They have 7 vertebrae just like us!
so you're telling me they're about as tall as the average height of exes (probably)
HEHE TY i love it
3/4 exes were at least 6ft or taller
Exes like Exe partners?
yep
XD
i don't even find em, they find me
same here zoe!!
although i'm way better at advice for bad ppl to not date lmfao
i would like to date 👉👈
it's okay jenny and zoe, if you both need hugs i'll give them all to you
yay :))) will lyk if i need a hug any day
yes sam
You should trust your instincts and just be upfront about it
YES
commitment is hard!!! and talking!!!!
i have met so many bad vibes ppl so i kinda developed a bit of a radar
t r u e
and then if you have trust issues & stuff it gets even harder
It’s my favorite pastime second time singing
lmaooo dw zoe, you match my energy
Who hurt you? Was it the group projects?
talk as much as you want with me
not the group projects 😭😭😭
oh i did lmao
The group projects of dooom
lmao my group projects went good cause i found decent people who did their parts lmao
LOL
lmaooo my teachers probably question how i get good grades
respectfully, this is such a you thing to do
HI
Im Jeremy
it's not morning
hi joe
not until we wake again
joe politz <333
at 12 am, my chaotic energy switch just kinda flips
12 am isnt the morning though!!!
and then i have a hard time stepping away from conversations and actually sleeping
It’s morning?
LOVE THIS
YES
pffft you wouldn't know that
its like how 12 pm isnt night
i remember it was like 1-2 am a few days ago and josh joined us
Good morning GOOD MORNING duh duh duh duh duh GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING TO YOU
i hope i'm not scaring anyone who's still awake lmfao
page 1 of 34
i don't even drink coffee because caffeinated tea does a number on me
oh
it's night somewhere else in the world
I read your guys messages when I wake up
ahahahahh
also ur class was boring x
you should have said you had issues with the school lmao assigning so much hw
oh my im annoyed i used to try to sleep in class but i'd fail lmaoo
lmao i also have long term memory loss
:')
yes
yikes my guys
i slept through my english and it did *nothing*
bc i'd sleep at 7 am and have to wake up for school or smth at 7:55
i just get those random moments when i'm super tired
So it’s not worth it
yeah i got to be really careful about my afternoons
i feel this so hard
wait whyyyyyyyyyyy?
i feel like im more tired after sleeping but its not like i'd have been doing anytihng productive
this is probably part of the reason why the whole "aerin is a cat" thing started in the first place i-
I don’t know why? I wake up from naps with headaches and I clench my jaw and even if I’m in bed I wake up just angry
awwwwwwwwwwww
oh no that sucks :((
i swear quarantine did a number on me and my brain flipped upside down
XD
i used to be like hisss hugs
I give hugs out like it’s no ones business
now i'm like i will give everyone hugs if they want em as long as they're not creepy
I’d hug all our friends good morning
and i also have become exceedingly overaffectionate and talkative
Jenny is like ask me before for hugs please
i can never get out of the getting hugged phase
and people started being so annoying bc i hugged a guy. just because he was a male.
i like to ask before b/c i know some people are like really uncomfy
Accommodation for affection
Y E S
yeah i think usually there are a few people i always hug when i see but for others, gotta at least ask the first time or be close lol
i am also really the type to randomly say "i love you platonically" to people
we love consent
just to remind them they're loved
🥰
i love you too (platonically)
oh thats kinda awkward
i tack on platonically unless i mean it otherwise
Imagine that XD
because i don't want misconceptions
LOL
some people think i send hearts because i like them, like no i send them to everyone ❤️
Lol
oh yeah and i friendzoned him so hard at that time lmfao
Imagine having this much game
wdym lmao
The ability to worry about this stuff seems intense
i didn't even know i was friendzoning but eh
i dontsend hearts all that often but i kinda adapt to the person so if someone is a heart sender ill start doing it too
for example, i was volunteering at my school art show and being nice cause well i was volunteering and this senior started hitting on freshman me
I love gifs and emojis
once i get comfy with people i do it often
❤️ ok
SAME
i find it too hard to find gifs
💜
oh-
the dude even offered to take me home it was like wayyy too far
Anyways awkward for him cause I apparently broke his heart.
ooof but i am equally easily confused too
THIS BAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAH I FELT SO HARD
i just don't get it
did you think you were going as friends
ME
<3333
people really have to tell me otherwise i'm just like cool ig
Cause he was my friends friend. So I was like: sure? FRIENDSHIP
lmaooooo
FRIENDSHIP!
y e s
I can’t tell when people are joking or not
sameeeeeeee
And like slang is really difficult for me sometimes
SAME
LOL
i really went and googled like "what does this emoji mean"
Me too
i didn't even know what cap meant
i only know cuz one frined used it in every other sentence or smth
but lie is also 3 letters?
people just wanna sound cool or somthing
i always end up being like "what do you mean"
Mood
and then people are like "awww you don't know" as if it's cute i didn't get it
at this point im too afraid to ask
i just ask because i really live under a rock sometimes
That happens to me too much.
i swear people are just like ur so cute
I feel like I’m betraying my programming partner
i had a former classmate who would take a bunch of photos of me b/c they thought i was cute/pretty
Shouldn’t they ask you first?
it was weird knowing that they had a whole album with pictures of me and they were candids
^
i kinda just got used to people kinda doing things like that without asking lmao
bad.
lmaooooooo
uhhh are you ok with it now? or just ppl youre already friends with
i mean i can't controll them lmfao
normalizing it does not make it right </3
i knowww
I can’t like get mad at them cause I’m at work
honestly i hate that
But you’re not at work, so get mad.
the whole if you're at work you can't tell someone they're being a bad human
LOL
lmfao
Just carry around my bow?
nah my solution is usually find someone intimidating and stay around them
SLIGHTLY NEAR UCSD
lmaooooo
FOR REAL
wha t
oh my gosh
the last time a saw a machete was in back for blood
Or like these kitty knuckles
although i had a short friend (the one going to u of t) who is intimidating because computer skills
ooh the brains are intimidating too
exactly
aerin youre taller than me you can be my intimidating bodyguard :oo
but i do get curious about people's height
I think I can be intimidating
i coulddd
eh
lmaoooo zoeeee
so talll
yeah sam is really talllllllllllllll
https://tenor.com/view/puppydogeyes-cute-hair-gif-5439366
i'm a whole five inches shorter
but are not
honestly i can really scare people
Awww
but for the wrong reasons
I’ll just get angry, angry people are intimidating.
i can keep my face expressionless for a really long period of time
some people are cute angry
i think i creeped out a teacher with that
I don’t think I’m cute angry.
i usually fall under that category
oh in middle school i would scare seniors or wtv bc i used to apparenly glare a lot
ahahahahah
If you glare at me I’d probably cry XD
i am a huge crybaby too
But if you’re zoning out I zone out at my brother all the time
when i'm getting confused or flustered or trying to make a point
Mood
idk there's my cute angry
i just tear up whenever im talking with an authority figure its so annoying
oh i just have no expression when i talk to authority figures
ugh thne people think that its just a joke or youre not actually mad and its annoying
my facial muscles just kinda die
mhm and they just think they did nothing wrong if youre mad at them
when my facial muscles are dead people are always like "i can't read you" but i also don't care enough to actually idk express myself
When can we have normal conversations with our parents
rightttttttttttt
i have 0 idea if i ever will tbh
but i also don't have enough energy or ability to be petty enough
yeah i cannot express myself i used to be expressionless/glaring 24/7
i felt that
like im petty but then i just dont even think its worth it anymore
i didn't glare but i had no expressions because idk that's how i hung out with toxic people
i try to stay away unless i know them lmao
well she approached me
why would she do that
i just kinda wanted to cuss her out but like idk
irritating
i know right
like theres a difference between being friendly and just being
i was gonna swear but her kid is 12
idk
pushy?
ah was her kid around?
just her son
they think that since they know you in some way they have all rights
i know which is why i was going to be petty and not respect her since she didn't respect me as an 18 year old
welp will you have to see her anymore?
idk i don't really want to hang out with her children lmfao
yeah lol thats just kinda awkward
i'll find out on thursday or friday this week if we have to see them this weekend
hope you dont 😩
ahahah me too me too
also good night zoe maybe
okay we should really sleep
hope shes sleeping
actually really, goodnight everyone
yeah we probably should
because we have class at 8 tomorrow ahahahahahah
goodnight see yall in less than 7 hours!!

CAT 😭
;w;
https://tenor.com/view/cute-cat-oh-yeah-awesome-cats-amazing-gif-15805236
omg house of memories is soooooo good
welp guess we;ll find out when we get there!!
AH I LOVE THAT ONE ZOEEEEEE
i love that so much
https://tenor.com/view/heart-cat-kitty-cute-gif-11087999

honestly once i got hyperaware of cats, i realized there are actually a lot of cats near my house
https://tenor.com/view/love-lick-kisses-cute-cats-gif-12418179
AH ZOEEEE THAT"S SO CUTE TOO
theyre so cute ;-;
whenever i see cats or dogs i just feel really happy
oh no are flat faces always bad for the cat?
i think it's kinda like the whole thing with bulldogs and it being hard to breathe
The issues are like, you wanna drink water as a dog or cat with a flat face you can drown. They tend to have more biological/genetic issues because of inbreeding and because their gene pool becomes weaker. It's just not good because the birth defects or health problems can make the animal miserable. xD
honestly i like mixed breeds more for that very reason
It's just important to know these sorts of things if you want to adopt an animal or rescue an animal you know about possible health concerns and stuff.
plus they're actually v v v cute
imma cry with it fr like omg
omg that is really not cute
how is it not allowed
i'm going to have to meet with two different ones cause of my weird situation
and I overlapped them on accident
ohhhhhhhhh
wait zoe did you already set up your courses?
i mean my cogsci just has a bunch of prereqs and a math class or maybe a million i have to take
yeah i didnt plan enough to have that problem yet
then i'm onto upper division stuff
wait what spec are you in cogsci aerin
machine learning & neural comp
me too LMAO
omgggg we can suffer togetherrrrr
i didnt choose that bc i dont want more math classes LOL
i mean i did calc ab ;w;
i did calc ab y but that's only cus i took accelerated precalc or whatever
i skipped precalc trig at my school b/c i could
oh bet
our school had this weird setup where if we took a specific math class we could skip that part so i did
i think ours is like alg 1 > geo > alg 2 > precalc ??? but it depends where u start as a freshman
oh we were on the integrated math system so it went something like
then AB and BC in one year 💀
i feel like doing ab bc in a year is nice since you'd only need 1 ap test, the bc one
No problem!
i keep saying this but i really love this playlist
now that you're pointing it out im scared
ahahaha which is exactly why i had to change my profile picture lmao
shit why did you have to tell me

yes

good luck
❤️
hiiii :D
i heard that song on good doctor!!
ooh i havent watched(?)
i really like medical shows, i think it started from when i was a kid
oh wow ive barely seen medical stuff because blood and everything just makes me shriek lmaoo
how's everyone doing? and please join us, we can talk about literally anything
my sister likes greys anatomy and sometimes she pauses it on a literal cut open stomach just to show me i-
i-
parasites 🥴
r i g h t ?
hi!!!
hi alexxxxxxxxxx :3
hi aerinnnnn!
ngl the only grey's anatomy i knew for the longest time was that old medical textbook
i only know the tv show lmao
opposites
didnt even know there was a textbook lmao
who put chasing fire by lauv? it's so nice
wait wouldn't it show the pfp of the person that put it there
yeah i think the show's name is from the textbook
oo me :) i think song got me into lauv!!
i think the first time i heard lauv was when he did a song with troye sivan
probably?? i haven't heard that song in forever tho
i had my troye sivan phase in 8th grade or something
middle school
lmao middle school
i like strawbs and cigs the most hehe
nostalgia really hits now ahahahahah
fr when i was scrolling through songs i heard some that i completely fogot about for years!
SAME
we rediscovering fr
it's like discovering ancient history istg
LOL ikr and sometimes i cringe thinking about specific phases
fr fr
felt
like when i dug out/rediscovered the bracelets i bought years ago for bands i no longer listen to i-
going through my liked songs @ the bottom is an interesting journey
i didn't realize how long i've been using spotify lmfao
samee omg my first playlist was 2016
i had a highly regrettable purchase when i bought a bunch of black butler posters
ah did you get over it?
i never hung up the posters and i'm not about to take them with me to college aaaaaa idk what i was thinking
ohhh
now i have haikyuu stickers :3
do you think one day youll be over haikyuu :o
i have the kind you can stick on the back of a card
bet
don't think so?
ghibli is a good memory for me i havent watched any of the films in so many years
i really wanted a nostalgia trip so i watched ponyo + totoro this summer
i couldnt imagine 😩 but new stuff is still coming out right?
y e s
i lowkey cant even remember which ones ive seen but i just remembered that i liked watching them-
aw shucks i thought my new favorite animated movie in japanese was by ghibli & it's not
which movie?
the boy and the beast
i think belle
omg belle!!! that's a good one :3
probably mulan tbh but it was more just admiration  ahahah
mine was snow white i think
tbh i thought most of their lives were too sad
yeah it's really old now that i think of it
like what they had to go through early on doesnt really disappear bc they have a happily ever after 😩
oml that's my gripe with so many storiessssssss
they gotta appease the children i guess
not just sad but also morbid af
yeah gotta keep it pg
disney censorship
oh yeah that would NOT do well with kids or their parents
if i remember right, the original grimm's brother tale the mermaid dies and becomes seafoam
that's the only one i actually slightly recall
it was really a dead dove: do not eat
ah the little mermaid grimm version
dead dove: do not eat is a tag people use for fanfiction and works that are pretty much as labeled to warn readers that all the tags on the work are indeed as dark as the author has indicated
ohhh fs
lmaoo i know really useless things ahahah
(at least if you read works like that)
sometimes it makes you wonder though
should be alright if i avoid anyways? 😳
yeah! the signs just specify what kind of dangers i think
i just searched it and basically only know the toxic and fire ones
i forget all the dangers but i know i got tested on them for whatever reason
thats interesting that school taught you that
did you all also have to do those lab safety tests?
rip my wifi for a bit lol
well it might have been just my teacher since he was a retired industrial chemist or smth
uhhh like the tests asking awhat to do with different lab equipment?
well it might have been just my teacher since he was a retired industrial chemist or smth
ah okok
yeah!!! that stuff and the rules for being in a lab
oh rippp
yeah apparently sometimes my common sense goes to sleep
F in the chat for that
fr fr
its like how the permit test is common sense
oh i failed that the first time too ahahah
shoot i forgot to keep practicing that oops
i passed the second time
ew like the rules about which way to turn your wheels ?
yeah!! those
forgot that you need to be able to see and let others see 😩
lmfao

i still have to do that, i'm just trying to kinda put it off for now lmao but i have a vague idea
what kind of fic :0
i have a few running at the same time, so majority is hp, there's one resident evil 8, and one haikyuu :3
i have so much respect for writers -0-
ahahah i have a lot of respect for the people who read them ngl

it's a wonder how i'm currently averaging 3k words per fic

I like the summer because of the daylight
hi timothyyyyyyyyy
Hey aerin
wait lydia, why winter? temperature? weather?
hi aerin
oh like how is it prettyyyyy
Pretty good
omg yeah they're really pretty
bro beach in the winter
that's good! :3
i just like layering
lydiaaaa do you like snow?
yES
ahahahahahah
Yeah
what's your favorite thing to do in the snow, lydia?
yeaaa i like that lolol
fresh snow is so niceee but ski boots smh
that’s one thing i canntt
do you do any snow sports?
i can ski but it’s been a couple of years since i went again
ahhhhh sameee
it was sad but kinda funny
well i'm glad you're alright now
lool yeee
i remember learning to ski, snowboard, and ice skate
ice skatinggggg
yeah i started with ice skating and fell on my butt so often that i quit
oh nooo ahhsjn
sameeee
omg loooll samee
see i did snowboarding cause i thought skiing was too hard
omg LOL
i swear it's so easy to fall over in skii boots because they really lock your ankles in ahahah
I agree
skii boots are really unforgiving smh
Never snowboarded
once i skiied into a hula hoop and i got a giant bruise from my skii boot
That sounds super painful
it wasn't though
Maybe a blood vessel got hit
trueeee
o wow
what kind of hobbies do y'all have
Nice
i mean i write a lot, read a lot, learn a lot of random facts to fill the silence :3, talk way too much which is a more recent development, watch streams, and otherwise fill my time with something
I tried saxaphone but couldn't get into the groove
omg stringed instruments are harddddddd
yooo sax is so cool
i joined a server with an activity req and went crazy within three days
omg loooll
i'm like ranked 8th even though it's been less than a month, granted it's a small-ish server
dang
i'm not v active in the c'o 2025 one lmao
How many servers are you in?
me?
Yeah
gimme a sec i gotta count
K 😄
36 if we count this one
That's a lot
but if we subtract the two i've been using to play with bots that i own, then 34
I only have this server
although i might have miscounted ngl
That means you have a lot of friends
i have to stay on do not disturb because otherwise my discord notifs would be going off a lot
Oh
i only really frequent this one and the guild server i have for a game where i have an activity req
damn this server is popping off 24/7 now
honestly it was so active during the first few weeks and then died
ah icic
probably my fault, i'm really chatty
ur keeeping it alive
ahahahah
I need people to talk to lol
i'm what you call  a chatty introvert
yesss def relate
but i just passed the point of no return a week ago so i might be more of an ambivert now
what happend a week ago
about a week ago i joined a guild for a game with an activity requirement
That's commitment right there
got panicked about the fact i'd have to talk and hit the requirement and then by the time i realized i was alright, i was already attached and had sent about a thousand messages
what
i mean i type pretty fast and i also have had a lot of practice
do u post ur writing projects online
yes
bc i wanna read some LOOOLL
and i procrastinate on essays
you do writing?
yeah
what kind?
it's the only subject i can do minimal effort for
i write in short bursts lol
i mean i do creative writing outside of school, but besides that i'm stuck proofreading whatever my family says i have to and doing schoolwork
and it takes like a week out of my life
i don't understand how i write myself
writing takes practice T_T
i just sit down and start writing what i'm thinking
ahh
and then if it's for school, i jam in the quotes intermittently
well, did
that's so cool!!!!
but senioritis
oh that's super cool!
oo wow
omg senioritis was the reason i was averaging 3k words in my ao3
i have no idea how many words i average
i used to struggle but now it feels too short if i write less than a thousand words
yea for sure
i get really bothered sometimes when i'm typing on discord and i hit the character limit but i'm not done with my thought
whaT
lots of times
wot the heckkk
i don't know
💀💀
oh i spammed my friend once , i gave them 100+ notifs in an hour
omg LOL
i was in spanish with nothing to do
in this other gc my friend and i talk so much that we blow up the other girls phone to 1000+ msgs every once in a while
nah my friend has their phone on silent mode lmfao
omg loooll
i swear none of my friends feel lonely cause i'm so chatty smh
that’s pretty insane
yeah *now* that i think about it, it is
me when i check back the gg gc after i going to the bathroom: 72 new notifs
okay same, but only when i don't know the other person really well and their reply habits
yea i just have really negative experiences relating to sending unresponded messages
lmaooo if you ever send me messages, promise i will reply lmfao
same, i can't stand to leave messages unreplied
honestly it just sits in my mind bugging me if i haven't replied
mhm
so i try to get replies done before i entirely forget
i can only kind of understand people who see they get messages but then forget to reply
okay but my parents leave me on read all the time
i feel that ;-;
yeah and then she'll text me back much later in chinese even though she knows i can't read it
i wanna learn chinese but ik ppl say it’s pretty hard -0-
idk it really depends
mmm that’s true
like i don't really understand much japanese, but i've been watching a show and i can recognize some chinese characters and i've picked up a few phrases
ce suo zai na
ahahahah it took me a while to recognize what the pinyin said lmfao
you would think I didn't take like 10 years of chinese school 💀
honestly i just don't remember most of the characters i learned before i quit in 6th grade
yES
i used to go to tzu chi i think and omg it sucked
those fucking white sweaters
i probably speak taiwanese hokkien better than i do chinese
i dont think i had to wear the pants, thank god
i remember how the teachers all wore literally the same thing
that was a joke
lmfaoooo
i learned absolutely nothing
honestly the only thing i learned was that the class was boring
i went to chinese school for like 8 years and i cannot speak 💀💀
the only thing i can do is speak
write a bit
all my relatives speak full on chinese and when my mom yells at me, you bet she's screaming in chinese
i guess taking ap chinese helped a litttttle
ahahahah ap chinese
perhaps i should have done that
perhaps, but i messed up when i didn't take ap spanish :p
ooof
i mean it'll probably be quite easy but yeah, sucks
only think i know how to say is "you are a fat pig"
lmfaoooooo
issa struggle 😔
fr relatives are, they always think you understand more than you actually do
just read through everything hehe
omg taiwanese is so hard to do pinyin for
i tried googling it and i gave up
i think the only perk of taiwanese is that other forms of hokkien are kinda similar to some degree
im the one they talk about
ahahah my family mainly speaks taiwanese but my mom's brothers both married ppl who can't so their kids don't
wait i say both i never realized
oof i picked it up cause i was the only kid when i was born
so i avoid mentioning anything but mama baba
omg i find it so frustrating when i have to explain who someone is relation to me in english
huh isnt that grandaunt?? i just dont kunderstand the removed cousin stuff
honestly don't know, apparently all the forms don't allow for that?
that is so strange
right?
i always forget who my cousins are and who my aunts/uncles are bc half of them are 40+ :')
oh wow
so it added up
ohhh that's kinda wild
oh and i mean large age gap with their siblings not each other ahaha
not that i know any of my cousins too well lmfao
samee i think most are in taiwan so i rarely see them anyawys
lmaooo i guessed it was that :3
but nope
c ov id
very bummed bout that
omg new zealand!!! that's where the hobbit set is!!!!
but yeah i also know someone there so it woudlve been so cool if i couldve met her (probably not tho)
lmaooo they made that set in like the 2000s
i should really see the classics
i think my parents let me watch lord of the rings
oh now i wanna see if i cry lol i used to never cry but sometimes the strangest things in movies will just break me
honestly i remember crying over raya
i think i always planned on reading lord of the rings but also never got around to that
ahahah
hmm
yeah it was one of the newer ones!!!
i think ive only seen the eragon summary but the book cover looks very familiar
oh that's actually really fair
oh thats something else i wanted to watch lmao i saw it on the plane but there wasnt enough time to finish it
the movie was different from the book, idr by how much
soo many movies and books are really different
okay this begs a very important question (i really hope other people answer too)
im planning on watching the notebook with friends this week tho so we'll see how that goes
y es
idk :(((
maybe we should temp move to dms until someone else joins lmfao
anyone else who comes, tell us about your crying movie experiences :D
y e s
dude endgame made me a mess lol
hi  again alexxxxxxx!!!
heyyy and bro the amount of times i cried was crazy
ahhh that movie was a difficult one to watchhh
oh i heard a lot about endgame but i didnt want to watch the rest of the marvel series to watch it so i never did 😭
honestly i just c r y
harley quinn?
idk i think marvel produced 2 harley films?
oh wait fr
cause the new one that just came out is a dc film
i didn’t know that LMAO
yeah idk what was going on with that
thats strange but i guess i didnt know the difference for the longest time anyways so i wouldnt have realized lmaoo
cause some people i knew were chatting about the new suicide squad and saying it was funny that dc took the marvel director and marvel harley lmfao
oh wait its the new movies in theaters now right?
honestly i don't remember
bet
don't mind me and my weird spelling idk what happens but sometimes i switch between american spelling and british or something
theyre the same word to me lmao
lmaooooo
unlike color and colour
flavour and flavor
lmao i don’t really notice the difference
the u sneaks in so often because i think during my troye phase he spelled neighbourhood with the u
ahahahah
honestly i just kinda go with my gut for spelling but i've also had plenty of correctly spelled words that i thought i misspelled
no cus same my gut is right hella
lmaooo
i check google too much when i spell words that i literally know how to spell
also not me having two different characters with one as my lock and one as my home screen
same
omg i type to fast and sometimes my keyboard can't keep up
it’s pretty much the same
awwwwwwwww that's so cuteeeee
yessir‼️‼️
autocorrect does me so dirty sometimes that i just turn it off and type whatever the heck i want
i hate that thing but sometimes i completly have my fingers off by one and those corrections are useful
it'll autocorrect all the romaji i type and it just kinda goes downhill from there
fr fr
also do you all have that weird thing where your phone recs you german or some european language despite your keyboard and your phone being in english?
LMAOOO
my phone and ads think i'm google translate or something
I had italian ads for a bit on ig😭
my phone is like you must speak some random european language that you don't
i used chinese google translate so much that my phone would give me a RECOMMENDATION every day to go on the app (like when they recommend you to set an alarm or open maps for somewhere you go a lot sfsfsfisjfk)
pretty much i just sit there barely comprehending what's going on
wow your phone must be bad at catering to you, their loss!
ahahah my phone recommends me two of my games
bro sometimes i wonder how the alg for that works fr
i will say youtube screwed up theirs
cus like sometimes it’s mad accurate and other times it’s questionable
i keep getting recommended stuff that i have never seen before
i just hate when i talk about smth and get an ad for it on insta litearlly a minute later
i can't count how many times i've gotten the same old spice ad
lol i have adblock on youtube so i wouldnt know what i get anymore
when i run out of posts from friends i just get cat pics
and boom a pizza ad
omg i want to disable snap's reels and stories
FR
their recs for stories are just kinda weird and really clickbait-y
fr it’s scary
i just dislike seeing the recommendations cause they have no taste
my first discover thing is "loren and her bf are relationship goals 😍 "
like at least instagram knows what i like lmfao
like it’s irl!
honestly i just have old ones
my ig alg is too good
they recommended a reel of a cat crossing a basketball court
i also only have old ones ahhh im so sad i doubt ill see the cats again :(
i have a bunch of cats in my neigborhood
there’s a cat that comes in my backyard sometimes
and then there are a bunch that i just see on occasion
excuse my voice LMAO
that's so cute
wait the fur pattern is so cool too
honestly i hope there are just cats wandering on campus
aww damn
do any of the mentors know??? 👀
summon them
ahahah how though
what how do they do everybody
hi zoeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

My family is thinking of at home karaoke.

make a card
Can we make a presentation with quotes and stuff
ohhh we could
And we can do SPIS Karoake recordings over it?
as long as they get to keep it :3
oo start writing down iconic quotes if they say anytihng
it would be great
bruhhh
i had this writing thing and my mentor/teacher? would say the funniest and weirdest things so we tried to track it but it got hard after a few weeks
it might be easier online? not sure
we kept it on a doc
maybe yeah
but it was def hard to keep track of after a certain point
maybe a google sheet
i found one of the things he said actually lmfao
"among"
?
?
ethannnnnn please explainnnnnn
LMAO
honestly looking at the doc where we kept the quotes we wrote for him brings back memories
i bet
that’s why we should do one for spis :3
gary and his wine
lmfaoooo
write poetry after drinking soju
yeah that one came into existence because i said i wrote poetry in the middle of the night lmfao
bet
sounds good
I bet 1 cent
if we’re gonna bet i’d rather bet hugs or something lmfao
Viable to change to high five
ahahahaha

MAKE IT BIGGER >:O

I cry when I’m tired XD
awwwwwwwwww
It’s a rule

I’m going to steal your signature and make it even bigger, mark my words.
i-
It’s the law
lmaoooo
Especially horses
it really is
Idk why
so i guess our spis giraffe is done
Zebra is the next animals for SPIS conquest?
omg noooo
This time you draw the body?… and I draw the head?
the pattern is harder
We gotta switch
i thought we just agreed horses were hard zoeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
https://tenor.com/view/hyper-gif-18023825

y e s
Can’t you see it?
lmaooo i can see it zoe

hi aerin :3
:3
just added a bunch of stuff i want from ikea to a cart
that sounds fun
i love capitalism
lmaoooooooooooo
fun fact, i have never actually been to ikea
wHat?
i went to costco yesterday and bed bath and beyond today
buying stuff for your dorm room?
mhm
omg lmaoooo
but i had it a month ago and it was infuriatingly good
lmaoooooooooo
never have i ever is the best game for people with no life 😔
my brain just randomly went “cards against humanity”
cards against humanity is so much fun
i was so caught off guard b/c i didn't know what the cards were like
quite nsfw
yeah that made for an interesting few rounds where i was thoroughly confused
LMAO
it was an experience to say the least
aha funny you mention that, i do too
oh you do? i died around twenty times in a row trying to complete the gliding permit's level 1 thing and then deleted the app lmfao
yea genshin is brutal on all phones
some girl i knew wanted me to cosplay a character from it
i can only run it pretty well bc i have a pretty new phone
so i thought i'd check it out but yeah game was too hard :3
ooh which character
lemme look in my chats with a diff friend i think i found the name
keqing?
yeah! her
main thing is the fake cat ears with hair
ohhhh
LMAO
i've had the experience of wearing fake ears
https://tenor.com/view/keqing-keqing-poke-electro-slime-immune-gif-20687653
and i also had a tail to match lmfao
this is she, for reference
is she just stabbing the slime?
with a finger, yes
wow
....what were you coslpaying
nothing it's been my halloween costume many times
if you dont mind me asking, why the objection to cosplaying as her
i don't know her as a character + no clue what her voice lines are
genshin is fun, but its also a lot
so i've heardddd
https://tenor.com/view/zhongli-gif-19298968
oh wow he looks cool
As of right now, you also cannot get him anymore
ohhhh that's interesting
So the exclusivity adds to the allure
i know kaeya's also popular
He is, in fact
ohhhh that's v true
A couple of my friends simp for kaeya
wow lmao
https://tenor.com/view/kaeya-my-beloved-kaeya-kaeya-genshin-genshin-impact-kaeya-genshin-impact-gif-20028977
lmfao
Although the chest window probably added to it
kaeya seemed like one of those noveau ways of spelling kaya
Ok I can kinda see how you make that mistake
i thought maybe he was just flat???
Ok I have to shower brb
okay :3
Go for it
lmaooo guess i will then
Didn’t the wow movie suck balls
yeah apparently
Mhm
like the shadowlands patch for wow had some seriously great art and storytelling and voice acting
Ah I wouldn’t nnow, never touched wow before
i don't play either game
I did the same for league lmao
oml league
Damn that’s wild
but i had an ex who played league
Red flag 🚩
ahahahahahah
Joking, it’s just fun to dunk on league
oml lmfao
I’ve never actually tried it myself
my brother did and he complained about it
Everyone I know who plays or has played league hates it
wait then why do they still play?
Exactly!
okay but i kinda understand that sentiment
I just don’t play games if I feel like it’s become a responsibility instead of for fun
lmaoooo i should do that
Bc there will always be more things to do
ohhhhhhh
LMAOOO
every month there's a new event with three parts
that is so sad
i tell myself i don't need every single stupid pixel furniture
Toxic relationship 😤
but then i come up with another reason to play
So I didn’t really know anyone playing for a few months
ohhh well all my friends were mainly adults who had lives outside of the game lmao
No sense in keeping up a job by playing a game when you have to keep up a job irl
lmfao yep
That revenge sleep procrastination or smth
lmfao
“Revenge bedtime procrastination” describes the decision to sacrifice sleep for leisure time that is driven by a daily schedule lacking in free time.
out of curiosity, how is it that you never sleep much?
I just like the vibes at night I guess
that's fair
Also I have piss-poor time management
oml sameeee
I still (mostly) function day-to-day
i-
It’s a skill developed over time
that's scary
@diegom1
honestly sometimes i use brute force to fix my sleep schedule
amazes me fr
as alex h said, melatonin
it works lemme tell you that
it works but if you overtake them they won't
bro they make u feel like heavy if you overtake
and then you'll have to hunt for the stronger alternative that i think is much harder to find
the one i take is two
but i know an insomniac who kept upping their dosage and now the melatonin does nothing
torture fr
honestly i think the only other brute force method is to make yourself tired by aggressively messing up your sleep schedule

lmaoooooo zoe
lindsey like 5'10
ohhhh wow
joe
w h y
Joe mama
lmfao
I'm trying 😔
as my high school art teacher said, "a for effort"
Then you’re obligated to say y’all
zoeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Hello
what are we naming the giraffe and are we taking suggestions
Hmmm
what's spin mean?
The air has to spin in a column
ohhhhhhh
Make the air spin
lmaooooo
I mean, I have opera, in the meme room.
i think i've seen you with your glasses in a zoom session though
Sorry to say
lmfao
You^
yeah
Ha ha
i keep forgetting how much work glasses are ngl
Glasses plus masks
aw shucks i don't think anyone else i know is online besides you zoe ;w;
https://tenor.com/view/anime-waiting-for-text-waiting-for-your-reply-gif-14108959
omg i heard they fog up so bad
I’m always online.
ahahahah
I don’t turn discord off
yeah it's because i stayed up that i have to wear glasses now :3
I’m just blind
omg no same
They messed up my eyes
so usually i can see fine without glasses, i just skipped wearing them last night so i got to wear my glasses
Allergies are crazy
they really are
Also crazy
lmaooo yes
What else is crazy
how limited the amount of food i can eat is?
To say whether or not that’s crazy
oh for example, i don't like bell peppers because they have this smell that i hate
That’s pretty crazy
and then i don't like most smoothies because my mom has made really thick smoothies and i don't trust smoothies that aren't pink or purple-y
Sorry I took a shower
lmfao dw :3
how abt u :0
lmao i've been having a good day! it's been fun socializing!!! honestly never thought i'd say the second part lmao
yay that’s great :D also nice glasses lol are you planning on wearing night contacts at school?
no clue ahahah
hiiiii i just woke up from another nap lmao
ohhh that's niceeee
oh yeah night contacts are annoying for that lol i feel like so many college students have messed up sleep so some stop wearing it
wait jenny do you also wear them???
only my left LOL
ohhhh
i feel like my eye will die one day because i always get lazy when it comes to keeping it hygienic too
also if anyone's lurking in the chat, please join ussssssssss i wanna try to get to know everyone in spisssss ;w;
i k r
omg pls be careful though
oh no what happened?
i honestly don't know, i just had a hard time taking them out one day and then i managed to injure my right eye :3
sometimes it kinda gets stuck on your eye and it hurts so bad to take it out then, but i usually check to make sure it’s loosened or else i’ll use eye drops first
yeah it really gets difficult
o m g i had to search that up the all black looks so creepy
i don't know how people do those contacts cause i swear it's hard plastic in your eye
literally... looking at those images makes me cringe in pain already lmao
lmao felt that
sighs my mom says i gotta eat because i’ve been sleeping too much 😭 that isn’t even a valid reason to tell me go eat but- lmaoo
lmaooo have funnnnnnnn :3
ttyl :D also always feel free to ping of something if you’re boreddd and *perhaps* you’ll be able to summon me ahahah
ahahah okay :3
Socializing is 10/10 favorite
y e s ss
I think they’re shy
i want more friends to chat with ahahah
I could be wrong though
yeah mostly girls
A like UCSD map app kinda like Disneyland
oml that would be so helpful!!!!!!!!!!
It would track where you are you know and show you the fastest path
yes and it would be great if it could get updates on wherever construction is
Should I ask a mentor XD
i think you'd need a few things
A map feature of some kind, a cute interface, and tracking as well as information…
yes
if you look up “ucsd map” there’s something kind of like that on the ucsd site
i think you might need a data set or take data from google maps lmfao
LOL
omg that's cool
need a live gps navigator
i wish it was an app
Aww
but honestly having a living breathing person is 100x better than a map
It’s nice but not cute enough
lmaoooo
It tells you information
ohhhhh that actually seems nicer and easier to use
So we can definitely do it
i took a ux design class
Ooh how cute would it be to design a little triton person on the front
lmaooo it could be cute
Since I deem people too hard
ahahah people are indeed difficult
I argue mouths are harder
hands and arms though
So it’s easier
honestly just drawing is hard
So arms and hands aren’t too bad
that's cool
I like bones a lot
i like the bones in human anatomy collections
It’s soooo cool
lmaooo i did not
https://tenor.com/view/hand-anatomy-movement-muscles-science-gif-20640966
but i still have my human anatomy coloring book
I just like seeing the world differently sometimes
that last bit i felt
Books are great
ye s
@ragdoll kitten your dinner looks yummy
ahahah lmao
🤔

their name is joe 😄
hi ethannnnnn
their name is joe :)
when did we decide the giraffe was male
who said anything about the giraffe being male
you and sam originally referred to the giraffe as him lmfao
i did no such thing
that's not what the edited thing next to your message says lmfao
i have no idea what you're talking about
ethan that sounds like something a toddler would say after eating all the cookies before dinner
yo don't bully ethan like this :(

honestly i blame myself for being like lemme post an intro!
idk i feel so awk
ahahah i was quite impulsive and did it
at least ppl wanted to get to know u LOLLL
i wasn't emotionally prepared for people to actually message me though ;w;
ahh yeaa
it's fine no one messages me anymore, even those weird scammy sugar parent accounts
SUGAR PARENT
well i had a a female person message me and i've had a male person message me too
ahahah yess accurate
i think the most awkward convo i had was one where someone reached out to me about lore for middle earth despite only watching the movies
yeaaa its fun talking to new ppl no matter how introverted i am :DDDD
i wish more people who are online would talk h e r e
and i would like to get to know everyone in similar majors :)))
yeah omg that discord is huge and i just kinda don't have the energy to keep up with all those people
samee
i get kinda curious sometimes as to why people don't chat here more
or feel awk? that was originally y i was hesitant
that would make for an interesting question to pose
true
okay but i like to think that i'm capable of talking to almost anyone so long as there's a shared language
Hello friends
but if both conditions are met, whatever people want to talk about at the very least, i'm willing to listen to hours upon hours of their interests
o hi ethan
hello ethannnnnnnnnn
That is a very admirable skill
i have very rant-y relatives so i can handle hours of stuff i don't understand or know much about
LOL getting that practice from family
it wasn't by choice tho
Well, most skills aren’t
~~i learned to sew because i wanted to~~
Ok, some
yikes my friends from a diff gc are telling me i'm not active enough oops
How active are you in that other gc usually??
oh it's half alive half dead
o
okay but lowkey is anyone else left handed here?
no but i used to think i wouldve been if i wasnt taught how to use my right first!
also warning: i took a melatonin to ensure i go to bed sometime early so i might disappear
and in sports sometimes i was better when i used it lol my left arm is also stronger for a strange reason
i type a lot so i am very quick with my words
but- i didnt even send a message yet!
i learned how to use a mouse and draw with one using my right hand but i do practically everything else with my left hand
true true
well i can't exactly use power tools without being extremely careful
Mice
they do but it's uncommon
i dont touch those my hands are sooo shaky
usually if you go out places, then you end up seeing the right handed mouse
i definitely didnt think of it that way
i have to turn them the other way
wait like with the pointy part towards you?
i'll just take a picture
hi jenny :)
hi sammmmmmmmm
https://monkeytype.com/
who me?
this is my favorite typing website
i have an average of about 60 wpm
but you type so fast
i mean it fluctuates
yoiks
oops
did u do the 30 second test?
it was the one minute test
LOL
i had to do one minute because my prof said so
is this like an intense workout or smth tho
ooooh niceeeeeeeeeee
my heart rate is scarily high from TYPING
what's your wpm?
o it was 100 wpm 99% accuracy lol i mistyped a few in a row at the end and had to keep backsapcing
yeah it was medical healthcare transcription, i originally took it to learn about chart notes cause i was curious
youre cracked
it was pretty fun lmao sam types hella fast
yeah i dont think ive seen anyone faster
i know right?
also used to be generally associated with males
honestly i've just given up and started going with y'all and everyone
Yea I always thought of “guys” as a gender neutral term as well
same but also some ppl have dysphoria
i had a y'all phase a while ago but i change my typing habits a lot
i honestly just go with whatever pops in my head first lmfao
besties <3
if i don't know what to do i usually just insert either a meow or something cat related
meow
i don't see why it can't continue to :3
i havent seen that word in years
lmfao i think the most random thing i started saying recently is ara ara~
oh i cant
lmfaoooo
me too never again
i also accidentally caused my guild to go a tiny bit crazy :3
go sleep
ahahaha
dont resist melatonin
lmfao i remember people would overuse xD
i got into an xD phase half a year ago bc sooo many people i talked to used it but not anymore
i probably shouldn't have posted my lazy halloween costume, i'll prob never hear the end of it hahah
:3 i started using it because of you lmaoo im v easily influenced
idk about that people went crazy over it
o wait was that the one that was a genshin reference or another thing
nope
ah still sounds cute tho and very low effort!
it isssss
oh wow i would never submit a pic to yearbook if i didnt have to hehe
lmaooooo i was in yearbook so i kinda felt bad for the halloween team and was gonna submit it
thats good tho :3
i’m gonna go for the night, goodnight everyone ! :3
https://tenor.com/view/good-morning-morning-good-day-happy-gif-11824011
good morning zoe!!! :3
good morning aerin and zoe!!
good morning sam!!!! :3
hiiii yall
good morning alexxxx :3
aww cutee
omg zoe that’s so cuteeeee
its how I feel when I see messages
also no mentors are on rn
Professors are online though!
y e s
ooh damn
there’s also ev 2 to do
ev2 is quick tbh
true
That was due this morning right?
was it? lmao oops
i'm like ???? most of the time
it sounds like multiplication though
i think it's either asking for the pair that needs to be multiplied to get the maximum OR the highest number on the list?? idk
i interpreted that as either submitting [4,1] or just [4] since it's four that maximizes not really 1
Can you give me 4 random integers, positive, negative, or 0
[ -3, 5, 7, 0]
Thank you ❤️
no problem :3
it looks the same unless im tripping
i don't know what happened
waitttt
i-
ucsd please construct parking lots
oh well, can't drive anyway
fr please
omg yes
what breakout room? :o
hi jennyyyyyyy
hellu :3
okay so it wasn't a breakout room
Dang
yes
ohh i didnt even realize the main sesh was a thing!
he was hanging out in the main room lmfao
I’m low key tired of the computer though what do I do
honestly same i kinda got hit with zoom fatigue
If you have any more questions, please ask away!!
i thought my humanities were waived for revelle and they weren't
Oh i didnt even look at where my classes are yet and i dont wanna 😭
why does discord have such weird emote names
And I realize some of the classes on my four year plan aren’t available rn
i need to do that
Yes, some classes are only offered in certain quarters
ahahah i'm looking at their default plan and crossing off a bunch of whatever doesn't apply to me which is a fair bit
So I’m hesitant to do anything that’s not a GE or what I’m planning for a minor
ohhhh that's a fair concern
Hum can’t be and I don’t wanna take physics since it uses basic calculus
a trick i've seen some students do is take some ges at community college over summer
I’m thinking of Chemistry and Buology
idk where they were in their progress towards graduation but it was something i saw often during summers
Then the next summers I’m gonna do HUM
i'm actually kinda curious about the hum classes
is that the revelle writing course?
yeah
Yes
i took more than enough college classes to technically have them all waived
oh wow i didnt realize any of the college specific ones could be waived
but they were like nope
oh yeah ive looked at it but i basically knew the few classes i had waived anyways from aps lol
honestly i'm so glad they took my science, my chemistry and physics were not fun
oh thats good then!
but idk what to expect with humanities ahahah
i think i actually barely need any more stem courses which is so strange to me because i've said my whole life that i liked stem >>>>> humanities
ahahah
(i dont wanna do machine learning or else i need so many more math classes LOL i forgot all of calc tho)
oh wow
oh what do yall need to take?
it's like whap
blegh
i did quite well in whap so i think i'll be fine
Degree audit is something I always check every quarter to see where I am at, and helps a lot to plan for the future. Its nice to see what classes you already have credit for from AP credits and CC courses
depends what classes
What’re you changing to?
^^^
oh i just wanted to add a specialization which changes the elective stuff kinda
ohhhh specialization!!! which one???
doesnt require all those extra math classes lol
ohhhh that's nice
but
it's fine though cause i know a few other night owls lmfao
i still really dont wanna do those math classes LOL
i mean i figure as long as i pass the math classes, i can make my humanities carry my gpa lmfao
gotcha
can anyone from revelle tell me how hard the humanities reqs are?
He’s my role model XD
ahahah
welp time to look at everything again!
good luck jennyyyy
basically ap lit
oh okay then that's not that bad at all lmao
i feel like i may not even be able to get into the classes i need though
you could always email them!!!
@John._. do u have time later to talk about data science?
i'm finally planning things out and i keep smudging my writing i-
You could graduate early
that's honestly a great idea lmao
Is there a chat for random questions I come up with like: is Michael’s favorite food lasagna?
we need that
someone could prboably make one :D
i will probably have really random questions
@John._. can we have a chat with random questions?
also i just looked at my remaining revelle ge's and i don't have much lmao
To get to know our mentors better
y e s
Lucky
lmaooo zoe i technically will have six years of college by the time i graduate
I took AP’s but didn’t take the AP test and did community college
ohhhhhhhhhhh that's cool!
btw, there’s some webinars (stages, if you want the discord term) going on in the UCSD 2025 server this week! the cs and eng ones already happened, but the college ones are coming up - server link here https://discord.gg/6rGpBksv5S
ahahah i forgot about those despite getting pings for it ahahah
also we cant waitlist classes first pass right?
so according to what i heard yesterday at the revelle thingy i attended they said we don't have a first and second pass for this upcoming enrollment
ohh ok
also hi josh :3
helloooooo
wow now you're orange!!!
how is it 7-
because time flies :3
even the ~30 min before mentor lunch lmaoo
i had all summer to sleep
im usually up much later than that as well
ohhhhh that makes a lot of sense, i'm usually up at that time unless i've brute forced myself into sleeping earlier
be back :)
i think i finished planning my four years, my brain hurts and unless i space things out i'll be graduating by fall 2024 i-
girl🧍‍♀️🧍‍♀️
hi alexxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
ok but how tho omg
i have to space stuff out but it would be with a bs in cog sci w/ my specialization + cs minor
wait how are u spacing it out pls😭😭
i'm not lmfao
i think i have 50 idk
i have to put in some of those "fun" classes because rn it's just jam packed full of my major + proposed minor classes
ooh okay fs fs
i just didn't put in the "fun" classes cause lazy
i need to do mine lmfaooo
i only put one and that was literally a marine bio class
film!!
i feel *slightly*  pressured by my parents to take a bunch of cog sci electives
ooh fr
yeah i think i have a few too many cog sci electives on my thing but i also stopped counting cause it got difficult
@.mentors does anyone have experience in postgresql and wanna teach a noob 👉 👈
sql? isn't that a language?
i know mySQL
i only know some languages by name cause i've heard them mentioned in passing lmfao, sql was one of them
uhhh
hi sam!!!
i think it does
i'd ask my brother for you since he knows more coding than i do, but i think i thoroughly traumatized him last time asking him to check what i was coding in python
well i'd say the best base place to start is just learning about some general SQL
sometimes i look at sql and my brain goes "squirrel"
will do!! i'm looking at tutorials and some of it makes sense
i had a realization
Am I blind or did the pet channel go away
it still exists
Ty
np :3
i was playing trivia murder party on jackbox
honestly the most interesting thing i did was draw a cat 30 minutes ago
jacbox 👀
it does, i still can't drive :3
yeah aha
i've seen people play it, it's very bloody :3
cool, neither can I, apparently :3
also hi ethan, sam, and zoe
hi aerin
my mom was yelling at me half the time when i drove one time
lmao my mom does that every time i drive
that reminds me i gotta brute force my sleep
🥲
i don't really see any rush to learn though
ill forget everything in the year
technically i only need to learn enough to pass the driving test
yes!!

frog cat
y e s
Here I can add you on steam wanna dm me your friend number thing?
zoeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
We arent gonna play tonight 😮
i knowwwwwww
We were gonna do it tomorrow
y es
Im getting off my game tonight, I gotta be awake for lecture xD
right the lecture
Yes lecture XD
i know i should be getting to bed buuuuuuuuuuut also staying up late
Cause I feel like that’s weird
i sit in a chair for hours and i feel nothing lmao
Like I’m just taking notes in bed and can’t see anything
ohhhhhhhhhh
Or I’ll like roll around
lmaoooo
It’s not worth it
i think the only embarrassing thing that could pawsibly happen rn would be me making random faces at the camera
XD why would you do that
idk where i show up on zooms for everyone else, but if i think no one is watching i make a weird face
0/10
plus if someone does catch me making a funny face, i bet it makes them laugh
So I try to not look
ohhhh that's fair
And I feel inclined to comment on them
yes they dooooooooo
For this quarter at least
yayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy that's great!!!!!
XD
i made and promptly forgot what i'm taking
How scary
like i have the thingy and then i forgot
So you do know just not right now?
i think picking classes isn't that scary compared to everything else
i painted with my friend but the paintings r horrendous 🤣🤣
i don't remember but i know i did it
I think it’s more scary than public speaking
oh that reminds me zoe, are you going to get back 4 blood?
What does that mean?
really? i must be desensitized then
I just want to be academically ready, challenged, and like good
that is fairrrrrrrrrrrrr
That’s what college is for me XD academics.
oh college is social time for me
Cause it’s not gonna be easy to pay for it
so trueeeeee
I already feel kinda bad for staying in the dorms when I could commute
i think commuting can change the experience you have though
But mom doesn’t want me to commute and says college dorm experience is really important
cause my local school is sjsu and it's a full blown commuter school
Idek how I would commute because all the parking would be full
that is also trueeeeeeeeeee
And college is expensive
oh fr it is crazy expensive

https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/775661361187258438.gif?v=1
It’s so stressful
yes
And I have to take breaks because I get so scared that I’m shaking and sweating
i think i've seen someone play it?
But I’m getting better with it
yayyyyyy go zoe!!! :3
I’m just a wimp XD
i think i watched dead by daylight 2 once
There are tools and stuff to help or hinder you
yeah i saw dead by daylight 2 last month
It was on sale I think
it was indeed difficult
I bought it with money I earned
my brain did another inside out thing
XD
i give up
XD
i guess it makes sense since it was so bloody
And crouch to hide or be softer
oh that is cool!!!!!!!!!
My friends said I shouldn’t watch cause I’d get nightmares
i think the first horror game i ever saw played was outlast
And I do get nightmares XD
awwwwwwwwwwwwww
Oh I don’t know that one
then i think after that it was silent hill series
Honestly, John makes me wanna go back and play league of legends
you used to play?
But I uninstalled that game and plan to keep it that way
also hi sammmmmmmmmm
I have over 500k points in Morgana
lmaooooo
This one
oooh she's prettyyyyyyyy
She’s super pretty
i only really remember the k/da members lmao
BUT SEEIN JOHN PLAY IT MAKES ME WANNA PLAY IT
she looks magicalllllll
ITS NOT GOOD FOR ME
lmaoooooooo
https://tenor.com/view/riot-games-riot-morgana-kayle-league-of-legends-gif-19025539
oooh she can flyyyyyyy
But seeing friends play it makes me wanna just hop on and play

Kinda like Recursion, but a million times worse
ohhhh yeah those kinds of people suck
Of my anger were recursive and had looped at least 20 times
for the longest time i only knew one person who played league and he had *i s s u e s*
That’s how angry I’d get
oh my! that's not good 0-0
for real
they can be
So so true, or they’re so competitive
i don't know, my biggest mistake was dating that dude
good for you
and now he stalks me
Get a restraining order
lmaooo zoe
I think you should talk to the police
it;s the same dude though
@crossboy do you know law stuff
he's the creepy stalker dude who sent me his contact info a year after i blocked him
For a restraining order
unfortunately, one of the other girls he stalked said that police did nothing
That’s why you get a restraining order
i'm in no immediate danger lmao
Say you feel unsafe
~~he should have been arrested a year ago but wasn't~~
Aerin you gotta travel in a pack
i knowwwwwwwwwwwwwww
I’m seriously concerned
pfft i have four exes and he's the only one creepily attached but it's fine
Like this can develop to worse things
i know
I would have to say I don’t agree because anything can happen in peoples brain
i highly doubt i'm in any danger
If he shows up on campus you get the police involved
he's not going to come to ucsd lmao
If you won’t then I will or someone else will because that’s not okay
i already had my school's counselor block where i'm going to college
Well that’s good
yeah!!! dw though, i'll be all good :3
Idk Aerin I still think more adults need to be involved.
but zoeeeeeeeeee
What he is doing ISNT okay
i know
I know you’re an adult but I don’t feel like we are true adults
ahahahahahah
Because he has facial hair
lmaoooooo
I kinda got sucked in to that one though I wanted to check the D3S one too
i’m not sure if i wanna join that club yet :3
Or that makes sense
not particularly tbh
Unless we count every recipe as an algorithm
i don't think every club you join has to be related to your major thoughhhhhhhh
That’s true
i remember when one of the ucs visited my school they said they had a costco club
Costco is awesome
it isssssssssss
But I like muffin
their muffins are biggggggggg
You just have enough food for a while
wow that's a long time
But I think I got hungry in the middle of coding and ignored it
still,,, isn;t that around 11 hours
Sorry
disordered eating just means i don't eat on a regular schedule
Ohhh
sometimes i eat all three meals and sometimes it's just one
Any less is concerning cause you gotta feed your body to work
lmaoooooooooooooo
Or eggs and stuff
oh bagels are fun!!!
LOL
hi lydiaaaaaa dw
sigh
time doesn't really function in my brain anyway
yeaa i just stopped playing
hi jennyyyyyyyyyy
omg 2 yearas LOL
i took my melatonin so i might disappear when it hits me hard
aerin sleep when you even feel it a tiny bit!!
i knowwwwwwww
gaming is not my thing
omg me with fgo
Gaming 😎
i'm not tired yetttttt
I play FF14 and I’m like LETS DO ULTIMATE CONTENT
nothing much, ethan, wbu?
i made a lot of gamer friends and i legit could not understand their convos
oml ff14
I showered
lmao
omg LOOOL
my brother spent a long time picking a gaming mouse
i relate so hard
and i didn't get it
I have a keyboard that disgusts people
i also heard gaming pcs are different from regular pcs
show
but i don't build the pcs in my family, my dad does
Same
i think the shells are really pretty
🤣
that would be hard for me to type with
Yea def
wait what's this mean?
No I can use a normal one my WPM is still like 78
oh that's v important!!!!
I just prefer this one cause it’s nice for my wrists and is big
i had a scare for arthritis/carpal tunnel and yeah
oh wow i cant imagine it but i guess as long as your fingers are aligned, it wouldnt be too diff?
using stuff that's good for your wrists is v v v important
oo
ohhh i have never seen that before
The trick is typing properly cause you just move your hands the same
my brother types fast but it's only aswd according to him
It’s important to be able to type a decent speed
so i laugh at him cause i type way faster with all the letters
Anyone interested in helping me build a pc if/when I get one 😊
s u r e
Me
i mean i've seen some disassembled before?
I’ll need to buy compressed air some day
plus my dad built the one i use when i'm not on the laptop
Good night
i'm still not tired lmaoo
i only have a laptop but my sister's was built by her ex lol
but good night zoeeeeeeeeee
nooo
lmaoooo
we welcome you but we cant be bad examples
we thought you were tired??
^

Sorry I tried to be silly

Good morning
let me pretend it's night
hi guys it is past midnight
good night to you too ethan
oop
that's a big oop
lydia youd better not call right now morning >:(
and also why i refuse to say when i'm going to bed
its still summer you can fix it in college!
ahahahahahah
but uhhh college is a fresh start???
lmaooooooooo
tbh now i have more incentive to sleep late bc classes are a few hrs later 😩
idk why i like being up late so much, i also can't see anything when it's dark
I haven’t slept before 12 in like three months 😭
one thing i've learned is no night classes
same i like night
the professors are super boring
its quiet lolol
mind you i was taking math night classes
i think i have one schedueld for like 4-5 or smth idk if that counts
it's so hard to stay awake and also imagine walking back to dorms in the dark
20c
i said that too and then i fell asleep in my calc bc
Which day
i remember having a 9 am discussion last year and it sucked
but i dont wanna wake up early
honestly i don't want early classes cause it's cold in the morning
LOL strip
i've been outside a classroom in the middle of winter so i decided never again
OMG AHAHHAHAHA WTH
wow you're gonna be walking far, ethan
Everything’s either full or conflicts with one of my other planned courses
i should honestly check
not sure how my priority will be as a cogsci major but i think i'll try to get it instead of linear alg then :)
ahahahah i'm retaking all my math :3
Oops
i-
Good morning
ah that’s fair lmao
better than 4 :)
omg sammmmmmmmmm
gm yall
good morning alex!!! :3
it’s finally friday im so happy lol
ahahahah sameeeeee
how yall feel abt that!
s a d
aww
i like hanging out with everyoneeeeeeeeeeee
girl dw we’re all gonna see each other irl soon :D!
that is trueeeeeeeeee
classes start 23rd i think
f u n :3
say less omg
that would be quite fun!!!
i have yet to go to a bonfire
i remember hearing about people doing bonfires at the end of a semester to burn all their notes and stuff lmao
i wanna burn my notes but im a hoarder
ahahahah that sounds so simple
my pre algebra binder from 6th is perfectly intact and useless
my mom really said i can't burn anything b/c i have a younger sibling
oof
that is hilarious
i would hate seeing that every day
i was so bad at the act math it wasn't even funny
yeah my act score was useless
i had to take my last one at a hotel near sfo
i took the act pre-covid
omg same
my school offered a practice test in sept or oct and it was soo spontaneous but i actually liked the act so much better from that one practice
4 2 3 6 7 9 4 8 6 4 2 3 9 1 7 9 2 5
to think i wouldve stuck w my crappy sat score ahahah
i tried to count them zoe
ik my score wouldn't be too good the first time cus i didn't study lol
lmaoooo i honestly stopped caring once the test was over
ucsd is also so much cooler
lmaooooooooooo true
ucsd actually stands for University of California So DCool
i spent a whole five minutes thinking of a word that starts with d
okay but ME
ahahaha
yes 😡
i mean it also says spooky attire
Yessir!
oooh that sounds fun!! i'll look forward to that then lmao
and its kinda fragile
i have old masks but they're dusty
Ill wear it for a little then or just hold it up
yayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
ooh i wanna see it
right??? zoe's mask is probably super cool!!!
i dont have a mask so im just using one of the zoom fake ones aahaha
ohhhh that seems cool!!! :3

lmaoooooooooooooo
that panda flop tho
doesn't that kinda depend on the ingredients you have though?
Hard?
rice cookers are the bestttttttt
Yeah sure let me grab headphones
idk how people cook rice on a stove ngl
are you gonna bring one to school?
who?
anyone hehe
oh i might cause i can make other stuff with it
Idk cause some aren’t allowed
that's something my mom will tell me lmao
I’ll find it for you
tbh i'm not going to worry too much about it
it has to be a certain watt i believe
i don't think i will be cooking much anywayyyyyyyyy
https://amp.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/cc4mzq/can_we_have_a_rice_cooker/
oh wowwwwwwwww
they should?
from what i remember reading i think it's based on where you're staying
Like you might need to walk to it
some have kitchens on their floor and others don't
our roommate process application was a good 2 months after all my friends' ones i think
atp gives me flashbacks to cell bio i-

darn it there's a legit reason lol but yeah thats why i sleep in whenever i can instead of forcing myself to wake up early on weekends hehe
ahahah i was supposed to be good at bio :3
i did not learn in ap bio at all this year uhh the senioritis hit hard :))
same ahahahahah
yeah i dont even remember anything that isnt 7th grade science level
ahahahaha i felt that
crazy that youre in revelle but no more science 😩
well i magically finished my science reqs
that is literally so cute and relatable
r i g h t?
lmaoo ive been looking at classes again because im just confused about locations
fun fact mosiac is such a wonky name that google maps doesn't recognize
i guess that makes sense but some of these new sixth buildings are annoying because i dont know the campus enough to choose something near it if it doesnt pop up lmao
yeah they really are
i keep switching up my schedule that by the time enrollment happens, ill probably just be confsued
wait they are??? i thought they weren't aaaaaaa
maybe its like how lectures are "optional" but you should go lol
well ofc but if it's not mandatory 👀
reddit recommends to email the prof if you wanna know before the syllabus is out lol
a r g h
welp after all that now im in the mood for ramen and i may go eat some *hopefully aps doesnt take me too long bc i wrote bullet points so far*
lmaooo aps
I tried sushi omakase for the first time 😃
earlier today (as in like 12 am) i finished watching outlast whistleblower so that was nice but also absolutely terrifying ahahah
Fantastic
that's goood :3
is that horror 😩 i watched the notbook yesterday but tbh i was just really done with the characters for the most part LOL oops
i think omakase is like chef's pick if i remember right
I went to this tiny little place in an alleyway
lmfaooo i swear every drama has that moment
And it had a cute ambience
oooh that sounds cool
Mmm that’s fair
oh i don't eat raw fish but for a different reason
ive only tried a tiny bite of my friend's once but ehh fish also isnt my fav
i thought too hard about disney movies and now i ruined it for myself ahah
I got the pricier one, I’ll treat you if I have leftovers come the end of the quarter
lmaooo ethan
Across the world, right
idk from what i remember it costs my mom less to go to mitsuwa to buy fish there and make sushi over going to a restaurant
Not sure how much I would trust grocery store raw food
lmao
maybe a bit of the furikake seasoning or wtv
kappa sushi is p chill
not even california rolls ???
or the inari sushi
inari is so good
it is until you have too many
battleshup sushi?
what?
forgot the actual name
lmaooooooo
i know i can splurge on food but i just dont know what i'll want
i don't usually trust airport food ngl
didnt know that
same
that too
usually i go to the san jose airport tbh
ah i havent been there in so long
i like airplanes for whatever reason but i also usually never sleep on them ahahahah
i used to throw up 100% of the time on airplanes til late elem school years
awwwww i'm glad that's no longer the case
i dont like it but i like rollercoasters :3
ahahah i'm so bad with rollercoasters because i don't scream, i just have an apparently very terrified expression as i cling to the friend next to me for dear life
im apparently an adrenaline junkie so makes sense that i like it hehe
i'm just really quiet but clinging like a drowned cat
also im gonna get off discord rn to focus on aps so uhh the next time i talk here i'd better be done lmao
okayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy :3
y e s
pretty much just questioning its existence lmao
a novelty!
lmaoooo
lmao
at least it's all sushi ingredients
minus the cheese and pepperoni part xD
it doesn't look like cheese ?
i think the second one is cheese lol
i don't think so, the texture just looks off for cheese lmao
actually yeah ur right lemme see if i can find the recipe
it almost looks like how imitation crab looks but it's def not imitation crab
transfer recipes?
yeah i had some recipes on nyt that i want a permanent copy of
that sounds like a fun webscraping project lol
idk i also like spending time looking through recipes and the comments
sounds like reddit but with cooking and recipes xD
yeah most of the comments are either saying what to change to the existing recipe or that it works or that it's a massive fail
could scan the pages and digitally mark them up?
but that makes it less funnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
i'm so excited
hi alex w and alex h!!!!
hiii!
move in day is kinda exciting
all my decorations and stuff are in transit lol
oh that is so cool!!!!!
got my moms old ucsd mug from when she was in ucsd grad school
that is also really cool
looking through all the sushi discourse hehe
ahahah
not too bad i think
my aps was questionable
yeah i think i get it although mine's a bit short
i wasn't tired enough to actually come up with good explanations
please and thank you 🙏 😌
i did it ethan :3
ah probably wouldnt be able to make it then :(
lmao same
also fr fr
who is mark rober?
im so jealous i love somi somi and mark rober
ohhhh cool
everything 😈
that kinda reminds me of julia tries on delish's youtube
yes
how has today been for everyone?
Gonna roll up to the SPIS meet up with my blue Razor
that's niceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
We can be together!????
i have to take 20A-E and then 18 and then 180A at the moment
Aww
but i did ask in a different server if it's absolutely necessary
It’s hard
honestly this is exactly why the cognitive science 118 courses are going to be the death of me
oh no please
hi alexxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
math
oh that sounds nice alexxxxxxxxxx
ooo
hi lydiaaaaaaaaaaaaa
hellooooo
actually is anyone else cognitive science and planning to specialize in ml?
bro im just like 😃
i am genuinely curious as to how everyone else is going to handle the cogs 118 stuff
we just gonna handle it
the 118 reqs are weird
wack fr fr
i'm really trying not to look at my four year plan rn ahahahah
same
hi jennyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
helloo!!
smart smart
ah wait i assume you would probably be done in less than 3 years if you didn't do machine learning
the only reason i even need math 20e & 180A is for that one req for the two mandatory cogsci 118A/B/C/D courses
no extra math!
but now my seven or more math classes will probably be keeping me stressed and occupied ahahah
they do, but the minor doesnt seem to require it
i literally just have calc 10a waived
same with the minor
i'm going to assume i can graduate in 4 years since ucsd did admit me and all
same HAHAH
but still i'm giving them my squintiest of squinty eyes
you have a lot of credits and people with none can usually still grad in 4 years if they work hard enough
imagine if i have to take math over summer
no cus fr lmaooo
if everything works out nicely then it would be so easy to complete the minor ahahah
oh my that seems way too much... i assume that'd only happen if they cant get the classes they need multiple times and end up taking other stuff
i mean next summer i have to take spanish so i don't have to take it during the year
afjfbfafai good luck
maybe? idk
best case scenario i only have one more MATH course (but there are still cs/cogs courses about math im nto counting)
i'm more concerned about graduating in four years ahahahah
im sure you can do it you have so many credits!
a lot of my credits are general elective credits so they count for nothing that i'm aware of lmfao
well enrollment will be good for you :3
i have 32 units of electives that aren't upper division
wait are your other units upper div? or fulfilling GEs
they're mainly ges
i remember you had a pretty high number of units so that actually seems like a lot fulfilling ge's
yeah i have like three left
oh wait aerin are you in revelle yeah
yes i ammmmmmmmmmm
youre actually really ahead then! even with those math classes i would assume you can grad in 4 years
ahahaha i hope so
marshall
ohhhh niceeeeeee
ganggg
is anyone else having a hard time finding "fun" classes?
history is mine lmaooo
i'm slowly going through the entire course catalog trying to find something
cus i like history
honestly that does sound fun, except i get the feeling there would be some papers involved
im not really planning on doing any fun ones tbh
hi again lydia!!!
LOL hii sorry im going in and out hahah
i am so scared of actually having the fun ones displace my lower division reqs
ahh icic ty for the advice
hi joshhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
hello
also that is nice advice
gl lmaoo
^^^
yeh same im just looking at the 4 year plan but who knows whatll happen
i'm planning four years, hence my panic
o how come
rn i just have my checklist done with all the courses and backups
interests rn may not be the same in a year
well for one thing, parents
ahh ic
so it's just best i have the idea of what i can/should do
yea fs
esp cause my goal is to keep my major and not change it lmaooo
but theres a lot of freedom when it comes to uppe div electives so i'll probably only look at those starting next eyar
pretty much once i finish planning, it'll be past the point of no return
ik ppl keep telling me that i can and its ok to change bc a lot of ppl change but i jsut feel like i wouldnt be able to graduate bruh LOL
some of them are so nice
same
their only req is upper div standing
YEAH esp sice im planning on taking 2 lower div cogs first quarter (bc i cant come up w other classes lol) so it seems like a waste since it fulfils nothig else
i'm really indecisive so i'm just going to stick with my major and tough it out ahahah
ahhhh icic
also like psych has so many ud courses that are cog sci approved electives with no or almost no prereqs
burhhr im so indecisive T_T i cant even choose my GEs for the future quarters
hi zoeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
oh yesss im def taking music
i don't remember how to read notes
eee
i'm literally going through the course catalog to find things
i thought opera wasnt offered this quarter>?
i hope both of you get the music classes y'all want :3
Imagine normal history LOL
i've been thinking, maybe skip the whole fun classes entirely and just do all my lower division reqs
thats what i was gonna do :3
me feeling weirdly excited about revelle's humanities sequence
Update there were no spots open
ahahahah
OH MY GOD
lmaooooooooo
LOOOLLL
ahahaha
YOU BETTAYED ME
betrayed^
oop
ahahah
there are currently 43 spots for opera
zoeeeeeeee are you going to take hum 2 when it's available in spring?
oo nice
i felt that too
wow lots of hum
i thought you could only transfer 1 hum course?
And then 4-5 you can take off campus
i-
do you know if they "refill" spots? or reserve some for later times? it seems dumb if it's all the same
you know what
Hum is probably gonna be fun
it's probably the only humanities i will be taking ahahah
i dont know much about it i just assumed the required writing sequences were gonna be annoying but maybe thas bc im in erc
i'm just banking on knowing some stuff from whap
WHAP?
ap world history
oh i say ap world but type whap lmaooo
yeah cause they slap you with a bunch of info
interesting
it's faster to type whap
broo i love how targets on campus
oml same
But I need to find XL sheets
oh that's niceeeeeee
i saw a shower caddy the other day but it was so tiny i decided against it
oh those were a total pain to find
aw :(
the sheets
still buying dorm things tho
SAME
i only have sheets bc im using my sisters
i haven't packed anything i-
ooooh
ohhh cuteeeeeeeeee
i didnt realize i need boxes and suitcases brurhurhrur
hi again joshhhhh
sameee LMAOOO
there are literally piles of stuff in my room
All the college stuff sits there
i just have this pile of stuff for college and half of the items are kinda getting dusty
idek when im gonna start getting stuff
i have like five books
idk what i need anymore LOL
ohhhh that's smart
Yeah for my dorm room and school supplies
i just used a list i found from the c'o 2025 discord
yeaa same i made a list for dorm but idk abt school
both
I only thought like pens high lighter pencil computer notepad
ngl my parents are making most of the executive decisions on what i'm bringing and buying lmao
What more do I need for school supplies
i saw calculators
i was planning on using my laptop for everything so idont even know
san joseeeeeeeee
sunnyvale
if you're taking more math, you need calculators
ooo
graphing and maybe scientific was what the list i was looking at said
ah i cant even find my scientific one anymore oops
i hope none of the maths i have to take need a scientific calculator
It’ll be okay
i'm going to wing my first quarter
all of us
lucky you ahahah
Wing* not sing
my parents will be mailing whatever i forget over ahahah
So stressful
okay but of all the people i know who are in college
i live around 2 hrs away so i can go home over the weekend or smth to get some stuff LOL
i have yet to hear of one dying of stress
idk how anything works rn T_T
i think i kinda know but it's okay cause google and upperclassmen
remember not to only do school all day every day!
if anything it seems like everyone's having fun???
my sister literally told me she was so bored in college because it was easier than hs for her (but that was bc of her major/school lol)
wait what major???
liberal studies or something lol she's a teacher
ohhhhhhh
but i dont think i have the patience
ohhh that's kinda cool lmao
omg yeah the designy art ones always have portfolio reqs that make me go o.o
honestly i kinda think the design specialization would be fun
I can’t find it anywhere
oh my
so it's still soemwhere around your house for sure right?
i couldn’t figure out how to say it
I’m just confused because I know I wouldn’t move it out of my room and I can’t find it xD
i think the best way to put it is that design specialization usually ends with people in the ux/ui design field as far as i’m aware
I’d like to think I’m organized …
but i don’t know how that fits with what i wanna do after i graduate
This is a problem for me later
i say this to myself too
XD
i felt that zoe
yeahhh i have no idea if i'd be interested in uiux (i dnt rly think i am so...)
jenny, alex h, and i are
https://tenor.com/view/disco-dog-dance-gif-13752673
sam are you also cog sci?
She’s computer science major
ohhhhh
I feel that
it’s okay zoe :3
I like asked John 10 billion questions today
you know what i wanna know? how much fun do disney imagineers have?
I feel so bad for him though cause I’m dense
it’s for a good cause
that happens to me too much its ok
same
lmao
you’d be a very pretty and nice rock
Smoooth brain
my brain is liquid slush
:CB_smoothbrain:
lmaooo jenny
DUMB
oh which lab are you on?
Lab 5
ohhhhhhh
The re-sizing step
ohhh we had problems with that
i feel like im doin everything wrong sighh
we missed something lmao
We got this:
jenny aren't you and your lab partner on lab 6 though
*well i dont exactly know whats happening most of the time shhh*
wait how do you have two images?
ID LIKE TO ASK THE SAME THING
you should only have one?
Like the directions said
wait what
https://tenor.com/view/batman-derp-tongue-out-gif-8169679
you're supposed to i think?
We just got excited cause we drafted out a plan
ohhh lmaooo
one of our versions just made the rest of the picture black so it was still 600x800 but only the top left showed...
well dw you have this week to get it done
BLACK
ours looked 600 x 800 despite the fact it wasn't
one of our versions is literally that LOL
we just left it as that
I always knew cause I did photoshop since middle school
wait what do you mean by that jenny?
So like pixels are important and bigger the better
my brain is buffering hard
Maybe i should cancel it?
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa good luck
oh wait
ohhhhhhhhh
oh my
oh wow that's a lot
i took uhhh 3-4 naps today oopsies
okay but my brother just started learning to use photoshop and i've just been dead inside
And give myself time to actually learn the stuff
ye s
that sounds like a good idea
^^^
But my health!
i'm sure your teacher will understand though
Yeah, she’s knows I’m busy. It’s just last weeks lesson I was so tired I thought I was gonna collapse.
actually i just realized i don't think i've seen an art history course yet ahahahah
wait isnt aps due sunday
yeah aps is due sunday lmao
ngl i got a bit lost in one of the later sorting ones
lmao jenny
LOOOL WTH
pygame feels like scratch
yeah
i'm honestly just learning from the labs
same
i feel like doing it is easier than actually learning it from lecture
The thing is I will type their code the same way snd then it errors
okay but i almost never move around when i'm home
-0-
i finally started understanding the errors recently
i have ~100 steps a day so college will hurt
and since then it's been niceeeeeeeeee
I stand for like 5 hours straight for work sometimes more
i can technically walk more than  100 steps a day
You get used to it
^^^^
Idk how to tell how much
i used to go to art museums a lot and just outdoors stuff
i used to be able to stand for a while bc 3 hrs of choir or more and i was always fine lol
and my mom always insisted on walking for hours upon hours upon hours
This is my steps from “today”
omg my athletic ability is just missing
covid just made me feel like i didnt have to try to move at all
zoe walks more than i do in a day
what the heck????
lmao sam
JUST TODAY?
i have 372 steps
i was literally in san fran allll day
ohhhhh
ofccc
the last time i walked a bunch was august cause my friend and i were hanging out before they moved
It was a 40 minute walk to the parking lot in the dark if we missed the tram
oh wowwwww
So I wanted to run and make sure we were safe and able to get back
i think the most i ever walked was around 18k steps sooo
XD
oh wait nevermind i found a record from 2017
hello what's popping
it was 26,272
i need to wake up early to mentally prepare for enrollemt
my walking history is really weird to look at sometimes it's less than 100 and other times it's in the hundreds and other times it's in the thousands
sigma gridnset never stops
oml sameeeeee zoe
All the classes are gonna fill
not even thursday but thursday at 9pm ahahah
Awww
honestly i will not even worry about that lmaooo
then sleep!!
^^^
mr sprinkles :0
gl lydiaaaaa

also good luck ethan
this one?
wait what time
set some really loud alarms my friend
ethan what time is yours?
But the smaller one not the smallest
you'll be in spis ethan
so you should be awake
how could you sleep through that i-
pog indeed
lectures are at 8:45???
im scared about tat too even though i havent overslept an 8:45 lecture yet
you know what works
I was late to lab hours by three minutes today cause I was stressed about classes
my mom sometimes will just pop in if i'm off schedule and sleeping too long
yeah i told my mom on monday and she woke me up early yesterday bc she thought i meant tues 😭
but also now that my brother is going to school there's so much noise in the morning
I got offered a place in a special honors Revelle thing but it doesn’t fit in my schedule
cause he stomps around the house
And it freaks me out
same but i'm skipping ahah
ok bye bye, gonna work out and try to sleep
i'd rather do 16 units of stuff
I’m gonna do it in the winter, but we have to keep a 3.7 GPA
good night ethan
13 unit moment
i don't think i could really wreck my gpa that badly
So I might just die
honors sounds like stress
An A- = 3.7
oh really? weird
thats scary
i'm not even going to worry about my gpa
i always say that lol but when i see it drop i know ill hate it
as long as i have a 3.0 i'm happy
I feel like I’ve always been an honor student so I don’t know what to do with myself
i'm not expecting myself to really be just peachy
but when it actualyl comes to it i still get annoyed
honestly i think the correct response is to kinda just let go of all the honor student stuff if it starts wrecking your mental health and stuff
In short it hurts to write
honestly i think mental pain and trauma and stuff really comes back to haunt big time
OH yeah writing hurts lmao
which is why mental health matters!!!
Today I ate lots of chocolate cause it made me happy
that's good!!!!
mental pain/trauma lasts wayyyy longer
that's great zoe!!!
So writing makes me cry
;w;
It’s funky
s t i l l
My brain reads stress as danger and threat and to protect myself it causes me to be in pain
ohhh i think i've heard of that before
ahhhh
ohhhh tendonitis is def scary
well your brain does try to protect you but that seems hard is there a way to fix it???
i hope you're taking better care of yourself now!!! :3
Like rubbing fabric on my arm
https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/775661361187258438.gif?v=1

Optimism!

heyy idk if it's for anybody else but replit's kinda lagging
aww zoe that was cute!!!! :3
mine's not even loading :/
yeah it looks like their servers might be overloaded


im just gonna peek at the aps lol
y'all i just realized that ucsd has cs in the name
university of computer science dstudents
lmaooo
YES
AGREED ! !!!
I liked seeing the data science people
i liked seeing everyone :3
"and" "ors" looking like boolean logic
lmfaoooooo
I live close to home, so probably not? Maybe my little sister.
i'm going to miss the sound of my brother's aggressive and incessant clicking noises
I missed my mom yelling at me saying the foods ready every day
ooooh what are some mobile games y'all like playing?
Also brawl lmao
oh those are pretty cool!!
bloons tower defense 6 is goated
i started identity v on a whim and a reccomendation
like the one from this morning
idkkkk
imma just do that and see what happens lol
okayyy
^
who else would knowww
He posted it under anncouncements
^^
announcements*
how's everyone's day going?
Behold it's blurryness?
lmaooooo
THE RICK ROLL HES FINALLY HERE
@Cinnamon Bun i don't think your ticket went through
xD
hmmm maybe go to lab lobby & ask???
tho
you could ping one of the on duty mentors??

i have to wake up early to make a phone call, i love my existence (i am being veeeeery sarcastic rn)
i’ve had math in the morning
all the classes i can take that don't cause conflicts with one another are waitlisted because they're all lower division since i have practically no ges left to take :3
ah yeah i know some people who wanna get into upper div classes bc nothing else has space
math at night is walking a thin line ngl
John did a good job explaining it
same
we made code for the blur but i still dont know if we did what they wanted us to
you should zoe lmaooo
but we started with like 12 lines of code for 4 pixels
lowkey isn't there technically two for loops running?
I would be impressed
i still look at that and think i'm looking at the war and peace version of what we were supposed to do lmao
xD
https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/775661361187258438.gif?v=1
So it wasn’t anything like for computer or data science as it should have been for the lecture
ngl i cheated on mine and just used my school's naviance to make one back in high school, not that i ever had to use it lmao
i only used naviance for career quizzes or wtv but that was useless t ome
y'all turns out i have junior standing at ucsd i-
who a sophomore🥴🥴🥴
i thought i had sophomore but i just called the registrar's office and was told i had junior level soooo it all worked out and i got rid of a waitlist course and replaced it with a upper division elective ahahah
i think it might’ve been on my easy request page
oh fr?
yee
that's niceeeeeeeeeee
it said like admittance: freshman and classification: sophomore and i was like 🥴🥴🥴🥴
i thought i was a sophomore cause i had 90 units but guess not lmfao
yeah no the 90 would def put you up there
it's nice to have an enrolled course ngl
hopefully my classification will help my waitlisted class‼️
right???
like bro please
^^^^
I'm fighting demons
what?
That's the priority system!
honestly i'm semi confused by the priority system (not the cse aspect but the other parts)
so the order you get into the waitlist still matters, because that's what decides which priorities get in first
ohhhhhh
they basically go through the waitlist and check "are they a priority? if so, send the email. if not, go to the next one". once all the majors have gotten in (or their time has passed), then just open up the class and all the people on the waitlist get let in regularly
so if i'm a freshman with junior standing does that do anything to my enrollment times or something
i think after this, youll have the earliest enrollment times for our class because its by units
ohhhhhh
ah did you finish making your sched?
i'm on waitlist for two cognitive science lower division courses
oh wow that would be interesting for your first quarter lmao
yeah and it would mainly be the fault of my enrollment time lmfao
and hopefully not many people have as many units as you ahahah
oml that would suck
i really doubt it ive never heard of a junior standing freshman lmaoo
lmaooo idk most of the students i know are junior standing freshmen
how do you hceck
the major minor area
i heard that for bay area sophomore standing is typical, but a lot of the ap creds dont actually count for stuff and it only helps w enrollment times
ohhhhhhh that's interestinggggggg
ohhh interesting, ty!!
wait if i'm junior now
thats sos strange ahahaah
right????
its just standing haha u’d still be a first year, second year, etc
lmao i know
Wish I would've done community college
i know the route i took isn't that popular ngl
ahh middle college seems to not be too well known? could you still have a "normal" social life if you wanted tho
yeah it's just really hard to do lmao
ahh yeah and you dont always have classes at normal times right?
yeah!!!
What is that?
it's a multiplayer game on mobile phones
oo sounds like dead by daylight kinda lol
i think it might be???
Dead by daylight >:)
hi zoeeeeeee :3
Help did the hamstring machine at the gym and now I can't walk
you could get a wheelchair?
I see you getting those gains. *I don’t know if people actually say that. You should stretch and take care of yourself!*
yes stretches are importantttt
How many credits is considered sophomore standing?
i think 45 units completed
ap and ib omg
lmao mine is college credit ahah i only took 1 ap class ever
cause some of my ap credit went into elective credit
yep they do
i have 42 in elect
i called them and they told me my thingy
whats that
oh god those
so rude
i think i know what those are smh
ohhh do they actually pay attention to if students use it
i mean most college wifi networks can see what you're browsing to start??
then they have to
oh that's quite interesting
Kinda tiring ngl T-T but there were fun bits
oh that's niceee
Glad that we can help!
thank you @crossboy and @orangehachet
yay that's great! thanks for coming!
it's eleven so before the day ends,
went on a date :]
awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww that's cuteeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
yessir yessir it was fun!!
that's goood :3
thank youu!! wbu what everybody else do
after aps i had to do my game dailies, then i finished up some identity v stuff that i needed to do, and then i aggressively love bombed a bunch of people in my guild and i'm about to go back on identity v and fuel my addiction ;w;
ooh that sounds dope
💜
I went to target
ohhh both of those sound fun!!!
ahaha yeah
congrats sam!!!!
so we had matching statuses for the day
awwwww that's niceeee
What are the odds
https://tenor.com/view/happy-birthday-dog-huskies-samoyed-dance-gif-18977118
kind of interesting
i have yet to meet someone with the same month
That is kinda interesting
much less the same birthday
Which month
it's been a long time since i met someone else born in january
zoe was born in january :)
last time i met someone born in my month was like 2, almost 3 years ago
hehe
i still remember being in school and the only person who was also celebrating their birthday in january was the kid who had the birthday in july and had to celebrate their half birthday at school instead lmao
sometimes games are chonky and use a lot of processing power for graphics or other computational things
ohhhhhhhhhhh
also im january too :3
OMG JENNY
Wooo what day are you?
6th
im the 17th!
ohhh niceeeeeeeeee
hopefully your game ends quickly lol go sleepp
right?
oh how long do they usually take?
5 minutes?
oh gosh if it's that short, how does it dran your battery so much
okay that round was exactly 5 minutes
have you tried closing all of the background appsv
and then if i'm teamed i feel bad ditching my teammate so i end up staying way too long
yike phone weak
lmaoooooooooo
Boooo
well i didn't delete it over that
and it never worked so i never played
ahahah no i died on one of those beginner missions 20 times and just kinda went "y'know what...." and uninstalled
whenever i start a new game i swear half the time i have to ask frinds for help on the tutorial
idv's tutorial wasn't hard, it was just painful ngl
i wouldnt know bc i give up half the time ahahahaa
i think the 15 parts was to kind of make sure everyone can actually play properly, which is fair because idv is kinda hard without tutorial handholding

@Jun Hwang

https://tenor.com/view/cute-smile-anime-cunning-anime-gif-15240250
my mom literally watched me turn it in like the first or second day of november or something like that
But I remember my friends panic
lmfao i would have been part of the panic club if my mom wasn't giving me the laser eyes
I think my mom made me turn it in like a month early so I was chilling
omg our moms really saved us lmfao
y’all ahead of things i was like sam lmao
pffffft not by choice, really
So at 11:57 I went on my phone and turned it in just in time
diego that sounds stressful
oh my gosh
but hey, you're here now! and a mentor at that so you did just fine lmaooooooooooooooooo
It was but if I stressed out in the moment I wouldn't have submitted in time so I just went crazy with the thumb typing
perhaps your true hidden talent is typing really fast with your thumbs 👀
LOL i joined a while ago but i dont think ppl really use it for anything except asking questions about classes or other servers lmao
yeah fr
watch diego fill in his social security number!
lmfao
"does geisel have a lot of books?" - younus ahmad, 2021

welp now it's lab time ig :3
thanks diego ❤️
when will we find out whether we're confirmed for our first choice project or not?
Do you still need somewhere steven??
maybe you should ping, idk if steven frequents this chat that often :3
Hey y’all! I was just at Costco 🙂 right now I’m still talking with the landlord, and since there’s a chance, I don’t want to spend anyone’s precious time looking for housing. I would rly appreciate it if y’all can keep a lookout for me tho thanks! ❤️
omg i just noticed that the ifttt bot finally isn't offline lmfao
it knows it's an autogenerator
oops
@ragdoll kitten
💜
Mhm
is it gonna be the chat carry bot
the only one who can keep up with aerin is alex's chat bot
lmfaooooooooooooooooo
That was one closing circle
we should have a gary day
:gary: for the culture
also i'm wondering how many reddit posts gary's leaving will spawn lmfao
national gary day
YES NATIONAL HOLIDAY
remember no leaks yet
yes :3
^^
big *spis-y* secret
got that Big Data
pffft big data
bet
oooh fun!!! what are you making?
Red beans and rice
i'm trying to drink lukewarm smoothie without dying
It's from a box so
red beans make me think of mochi
Yeah
@Cinnamon Bun remember airplanes? the song? i think i just accidentally stumbled on a meme version with sonic and chuck e cheese
I might just do jazz again cause it’s fun
ahahah i already have an idea of my "special talent" besides the obvious ones ahahah
Making everyone smile and cat facts?
are those the obvious ones?
Are they not?
well i also apparently created a lot of data for an algorithm apparently
Ohhh
which according to alex w may have gained sentience
https://tenor.com/view/anime-zero-two-cute-smile-nod-gif-13451534
but i guess those two are pretty well known too
Makes me smile
yayy that's good
^
y'all should drop by the zoom talent showwww
This ?
i was still stuck in my low voice mode and my dad and brother just walked by as though i was talking to them normally lmfao
i love that
they're really just desensitized to it
omg imagine if you used that voice with us and never talked normally
i do wonder that
I recommend cough drops and warm water to soothe
i can go for a pretty long time lmfao
imagine that but with an asmr mic
i probably already changed my voice from it
I used to do it a lot but I stopped because its not good for singing xD
what would it sound like lmao
like that but crisp
well i've been doing it since 6th grade so i think my vocal cords are already

ahhhhhhh i was going to go to bed but then i realized lck was going on and i kinda wanna watch the first match ;w;
theres an underscore between the two periods
yeah
john.\_.driscoll
lmaoooooo
anyway
yes
oh yes the beautiful linkedin pfp
i-
yeah she’s stunning!!!!
that's what practically everyone who added me said that
that means its 10000% true
i am soooo lazy
just created a linkedin to add people, why does everyone have so much stuff already 😭
i don't even honestly know or remember anything i did that's on there
omg naviance throwback
i think??? i downloaded my resume but mainly cause i don't remember literally anything i did in high school
oooh that's cool
i swear some of the stuff i have only looks impressive
aww thank you haha
i look away for a few minutes and suddenly i'm hit with five follow requests
XD
zoeeeeeeeeeeeee
@ragdoll kitten your pfp on linkedin is gorgeous
i swear that's the first thing everyone comments on
I don’t own a linked in and I think I own Facebook but I’m not sure
i mean i joined facebook groups but i never actually get active
Is Facebook normally a while screen
no?
Dang then idk XD
i'm looking through and the boba-heavy content is kinda gone now
LOL
you know what i just remembered? a lot of people like thai tea
all the tea flavors and juice flavors could come together at the same time and they still wouldnt stand a chance against the almighty thai tea
lmfao i guess i should try it sometime
xD
lowkey though i wish more places had wintermelon teaaaa

diego? what?
Go for it
that reminds me
jas;ldfkja;lsdkfj thank you john
hi sammmmmmmmmmmmm
hi aerin :3
:3
For refrigerators and microwaves, do you share them with the whole dorm or does each person have a separate one?
i think that depends on where you're staying
yes maam most apartments have a microwave and fridge
lmao and yet that didn't decrease the stack of appliances that i'm supposed to take with me ;w;
you have a dining plan. what you brining?
well my parents started piling things and so far i can only recognize a fan and what looks like a water boiler lmao
Thank you
actually you might wanna try youtube cause i think some people did dorm tours for diff colleges
Ok thank you!
how’s today going for y’all?
It's been going well so far!
oh my gosh the last week is coming soon
😮 I feel like the month went by so fast XD
right???
True
i *should* do my aps, but also i can literally feel that today is a good day where my voice is in a nice condition to be growly and i feel very very very conflicted
sept 18!
awww that's nice!!!!
but like thats a big gap of nothing to do '
omg it's like your suitemates and i shared a braincell
lol
i was mainly concerned about getting lost on campus and wanted an extra week to be able to at least semi-know my way around
im not goin til the 21st :((
ahahah i probably won't thoughhhh
lolll im scared that maps wont be helpful because i got very confused the one time i tried to use ti
i'm hoping that within two weeks i'll be reasonably aware of what's where but also
I can’t find my way around anywhere unless I’m coming back home
i only know how to get home from my former high school
XD
all the other places i've been kinda merge in my brain
ITS TO THE LEFT
i probably know my 5 mile radius from my home and that's about it
XD
i am probably not the best person to help with navigation, i've mixed my lefts and rights so many times
XD
like i hear left but my brain will say "just tell them to go right"
Lol
what??? 👀
It’s a guessing game
hmmmmmmmm
And it was to appease my little sister
hmmmmmmmmmm burgers?
But which burger place
oh noooooooo that's bad
Their burgers are good
that's one of my brother's favorites
I think I may have a heart attack
...okay but my brother used to grab extra salt and put it on their fries
I haven’t gone to in and out in like 5 years
that's so longggggggggggggg
I don’t really go out to fast food
fair
Is Rubios fast food?
restaurant i thought?
So it’s a chain?
my brain is mainly for cataloging milk tea and other foods i like
What’s your favorite milk tea?
i grew up drinking taro milk tea so that's my "safe tea"
Ooh
but i've been enticed to try thai tea at some point
Or black teas
highkey if you're into sweet teas, wintermelon tea is great
I need to visit Elisa at work TBH
oh you can adjust sweetness
So I went three times and never went again
i don't go to happy lemon anymore cause i have bad memories (not of the menu or anything) just reminds me of a person i don't like hahah
The beautiful mentor who is allergic to lemons
ELISA makes me think of my cell bio class
Why
i think there was an elisa array or something
https://tenor.com/view/yashiro-nene-hanako-no-smh-i-dont-like-gif-16549468

Goodness gracious
see i didn't exactly sleep through cell bio
I was just trying to emphasize her name
ahahahh
How’s your project
ahahahahahah i  have no idea
https://tenor.com/view/hiding-spooked-sad-crying-cold-gif-15759512
i think we're about halfway
I’m trying to avoid APS
how's yours
I think
but i really just wanna talk in my growly voice instead
Rena and I are almost done?
oh yeah tuesday
We have to code lives and then we have to animate the enemies
awww that's niceeee
We did a ton over the weekend
oh then it'll be like those old school arcade games
Hannah and John are so nice
that's nice!!!
I called things potatoes
that's good!!!
I love potatoes
and i remember that one line from sam about potatoes from the lord of the rings
Except when they have bacon in them
i don't know why but i imagined a potato with bacon growing out of it
That’s not a plant
i know it's not
I think I just don’t like bacon on stuff much
honestly same
So does my brother!
hi jaredddddd
sd post thunderstorm things
oh wow that's prettyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
But rainbows are so pretty
there was a thunderstorm?
But I don’t think any fires happened ?
the last time i got freaked out by a storm was cause some kind of summer storm was happening when i visited taiwan and i was like wth is happening cause the rain was like ahjdslhlagaslkgasfd
I just don’t like it
that is honestly fair though
We were coding and I low key screamed when I heard it
awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
Places with actual weather make me^
ahahahah
It’s an aesthetic I enjoy
i don't really adore snow too much cause it's cold
Snowman
have you ever made a snowball successfully though?
Throw imperfection
ahahah
terrible practice but
honestly i look at linkedin and just lose my will to update it ahahah
use a chisel
ahahah
which reminds me to update mine😭😭😭
alex hhhhhhhh
fr fr me too😭
especially after applying to college
Bahahah felt this
i just kinda went "no, absolutely not"
i literally made mine but there’s literally nothing😭😭😭😭
i honestly just find myself awed by my classmates who update theirs
literally like how do u do that🥴
and i'm here like too lazy to update it
say less henry
i have more "activities" but i just don't bother adding things anymore
LMAOOOOOOO
then i would have less work in terms of activities and stuff
LMAOOOO
i did so much work doing my activities on common app
it’s called being innovative
why won't linkedin save me the trouble and let me import it
work smarter not harder🦭
y e s
or confidentiality things i have no clue
...but it's mine???
RIGHT
or at least lemme import my pdf copy
copy and paste can’t b helping us here😖😖😖😖
fr
Sad is so great ehehehe
it really isssss
what’s sad lmfao
it was insane
oh LMAO
literally every other post on sat is just

that sounds hilarious
NOW I REMEMBER IT
wait
Boo is
but also that kinda sounds like asian parents sometimes
I was on sad once upon a time too
i went on sat
yall b easy with sad🥴
i've never been on sad
i’ve seen it a few times
i've only been on sat and then i joined the cooking one
Ain’t no way🙀
i just realized i’m in for a nasty shock this fall
yes.
zoom makes me think i’m eye level with most people
rice test yall
rice test???
rice purity test haha
ohhhh
lemme see
i have never seen that before
LMAOOO YEA
the last time i took something like that was either me trying to determine my character alignment or when i was really bored and curious about the love languages thing i-
Ooh I have done both of these
wait the rice purity test opens with the whole have you dated
ahahh
i think i got chaotic something
depends on what you check off tho
which was according to the general consensus of people i met, accurate
I can see it
what me being chaos?
Yes
...i guess you could
….eh heh
ofc i never had to take one for them ahahah
niceee
also groovy's bio is sad
aww since when did they stop
cease and desist
Whaaaat

Damn you Susan wojcicki

How does that work
y'know how people chat with one another right?
ehhee
hi sammmmmmmmmmmmm
ohhoo
hi ethannnnnnn
Hello
how was your day?
Panera bread is so much more exepensive than I remembered 😭
that sounds super cool !!!
Oooh of what
also inflation
https://bit.ly/girlboss_posters
that's so prettyyyyyyyyyyy
But then it dawned on me that three posters for a hundred bucks is kinda not worth it
yeah it really isn't
Everything is way less expensive in Taiwan
frrrrrrrrrr
So it has to be like subtle enough for people who are familiar enough with it to know I’m a fan
honestly i kind of stopped minding after my dad's parents bought me a4 folders for animes i never watched
While also just being generally aesthetically pleasing enough to work as decor
they literally bought me stuff from seraph of the end and some really obscure stuff that i've never seen
What are a4 folders
he got me a bunch of cute shiba folders
Ooooh
they're a little bit bigger than the american letter size
Send pics
of what lmao
Sure

That’s pretty sick
yeah
Resell it for a high price
nah
I love christian rock 🤩
lowkey i was confused when people were talking about donda- it took me a whole minute to figure out what everyone was talking about
A deathmatch between 100 snakes
wow that is kinda cool
lol thats what arnav said xD
also it's really funny how your console is printing a player died again and again and again
:' >
i-
omg
for real!!!!!!
@AerinBot
it's not in this server ahahahah
nooo
idk what the bot does tbh you'd have to ask alex w or jeannie
for now
ahhhh this is going to be so interesting
the wholesome comes from you :'>
i-
we're planning on it
oh that is so fun!!!
in emote form o o
yes
:discodoge:
💜
💛
okay but when that bot leaves the testing server someone with the perms should add it here!!!!
that's amazing
i'll have a name twin ahahah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyYHWkVWQ4o
Spis movie night anyone?
what is that i-
lol younus
wait now i wanna see if the bot can keep pace with me ahahah
same
when younus said movie night i was thinking something like  ghibli film
But a movie nigth would be fun
the last time i watched something with bean in the title, it was mr. bean and that was for my spanish class around 5 years ago
Sounds fun!
what if we had a move night marathon
right below your name and major/college info
i'm doing the survey right now, but who's christine?
niema's secret name
ahahahahahah
Mans is single handedly making their model go to 20% accuracy
