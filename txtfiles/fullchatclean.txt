thanks for coming to our opening ceremony! i'm happy i got to meet yall, can't wait to keep interacting with you!
is anyone else wondering how in the world they're going to wake up before focs tomorrow? my sleep schedule is such a mess lmao
I recommend going to bed a bit earlier than you normally go to bed. If it's dark you might fall asleep!
i feel 🥲
ahahah that's a great point
but staying up late is wayyy too enjoyable lmao

Good luck soldier.

early classes suck when they're in person because when it's morning during like winter, it's cold

mine is the 18th at 1pm😀😀
:cursedcry:
18th, 9:20 am
18th, 12:20 pm
Where are you finding the time?
webreg
webreg
the instructions should be in an email they sent recently
click the appt time on webreg
Ohhh
are earlier times better? how does it even work
earlier is better right
yeah
i have a 9pm time
omg that's lowk late
18th or 19th
i have 9pm on the 19th lmao
oh gosh good luck
gg to all of us LMAOO
we're both ballin aerin
lmaoooo
the time youre given is basically the window during which you can enroll! earlier times are better since fewer classes will be full, but other factors (like priority for cs majors to get into cs classes) can also contribute to how likely it is youll get your courses. in general, i wouldnt stress too much about the very first quarter though--youll get better and better times as you gain sophomore/junior/senior standing, so one missed course now wont hold you back in the long run!
yeah and the first enrollment is fully random! later on you'll get priority based on how many units you've taken (aka if your'e a freshman, sophmore, etc) including transfer/AP courses!
oh pog i got 18th

Sorry y’all I wanted to be at mentor lunch but Comcast decided that’s not happening today
@Mentee @Mentor  thank you for everyone's participation ! In my opinion it went pretty well but if you guys have any suggestions feel free to say throw them my way!
Throw*
i know a few people in our group thought that maybe doing a bit later in the session would have been better since it's only been a few days since we met everyone lmao
Ah so u felt  the skit was too early to do in the program?
I liked hanging out with the other mentor groups. So let’s do more of that 😮
yeah :3
thisssssssssssss
yeah let's mingle with other groups more that was fun
It was a rly good way for everyone to interact with other mentee groups though!
I see we'll try to see where everyone is at in terms of comfort next time and I'm glad u guys liked that!

@loshy
WAIT THATS MY FAVORITE POEM
Ha ha, it's a really good poem ❤️
yessss good taste here
I was trying to say the song they are playing reminds me of this poem, but the poem is better.
they are on entirely different levels
@NewtonC re: gradescope account
it was sent out yesterday i think [edit: sorry, two days ago]
@ aerin Thank you! It worked
no problem! :3
hello @MichaelI if we don't 🙅‍♀️  have out of this world 👽  clothing 👕 what can we wear 😔 asking for a friend 👯
@ferreti no worries if you don't have a full NASA spacesuit – anything related to the theme goes! You can switch up your zoom background, rock some homemade space-related accessories, or even cosplay a certain videogame that happens to take place in outer space... ඞ
a...amogus?
does anyone read haikyuu because i found a picture of bokuto from the manga that applies to learning how to program, among other things that require some degree of studying :3
bokuto BEST BOI
drop it aerin
okay but like i just remembered that one scene where bokuto tells tsukishima that the reason why he doesn't really like volleyball is because he sucks
do you all have any hobbies? idk it's 10 pm and i kinda wanna talk but also idk what to talk about lmao
idk if it counts as a hobby but i sell my stuff on depop but i used to make ig filters and whatnot haha
might pick up making them again tbh they were fun
oh that's super cool!!!
what ab you??
i knew someone who was big on cosplay and they sell their stuff on depop
bet that’s pretty dope!
lmao in terms of hobbies i would probably say that ao3 is my biggest hobby besides reading an obscene amount of manga
i have a bunch of smaller ones that i sometimes forget and sometimes remember ahahah
so, how has your day been?
girl omg ao3 got the craziest things fr it’s popping
it really does
ao3 o.o

I NEED A NEW SEASON FR
RIGHT?
LIKEEEE BRUH
did you read the manga?
the boys didn't just grow up, they glowed up
not yet but im planning to lowk
omg i saw parts tho
and fr they did
honestly it's such an amazing ending
i was so sad when japan didn't take the chance to use haikyuu to get people interested in the olympics
LITERALLY
like bro im waiting for the NEKOMA MATCH.
ahhhhhhhhhhhh sameeeeeeeeee
i wanna watch it
like reading it was nice
but watching it hits different
exactlyyy
like i need to see my boys in game bruh moving n everything
do you remember that scene where bokuto tells tsukki that he probably sucks at volleyball?
YES
i was like but why does that apply to coding too
i could hear bokuto saying that
and now i can't unhear it
no cus you’re right😭😭😭
still can’t forget when tsukki blocked ushijima bruh
i knowwwwwwwww
like that whole sequence😭😭😭😭
he really grew upppppp
ahhhhhh i was crying non stop
LITERALLY
and when seijoh lost i was also crying
bro idk what win was the best in the anime
brooo oikawa and iwa chan‼️
ahhhhhhhhhhhh oml
i also loved kyotani's scenes
it was hilarious watching him ram kindaichi out of the way
bro he be scaring me lowk like😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫
so aggressive but he got a mean hit fr
yeahhhh
i wanted to see kiyoomi in action though
omg yes
i was so happy seeing suna in s4 clips ngl
i hope they do a season where they've grown up
because i really need that
same like pls bro
like clumsy lev ||a model!!!!!!||
i-
girl what got blocked LMAO
it's a spoiler
you tap on it and unspoiler it
LMAO okay
it just says a model😭
i didn't want anyone new to the series to find out
yeah
he and his sis became models
yeah i remember seeing that
also iwa-chan apparently went to uc irvine
yo wait didn’t some of them go to the olympics
i don't remember if that was a headcanon or fr
YEAH
yeahhhhhhh
some of them did
ushiwaka & kageyama did
bro they really should’ve used that for this years omfg
along with a number of other people for the 2020 olympics
I KNOW RIGHT
like ITS EVEN THIS YEAR-
i would have spent money on haikyuu merch for olypmic theme
i would’ve been broke🥴
they really underestimated the amount of money people would be willing to spend
so worth it tho
ye s
i went to asia, specifically taiwan and i bought stickers for haikyuu from there
omg i wish bro
honestly i wish there were more places to buy stuff here
same like all i got lowk is boxlunch LMFAO
honestly they shoulddddd
i want more official merch
literally like bro i want pins so bad
like bro
i have to say the people who make the pins are cool but idk i feel like official is different
if they sold a karasuno varsity jacket—-
TAKE MY MONEY.
i think they do, but as a cosplay jacket
there's also aoba johsai vbc
omg wait fr
yeah!!!!
brooooo
people sell those online
might just cop fr😭
back when i looked it was just aoba johsai, karasuno, nekoma, and shiratorizawa
maybe fukurodani
ooh bet
imma see then
this was years ago though
i was in 8th grade when i first started watching i think
ooh fs fs
i swear 8th grade was when everyone wanted to be edgy lmao
i got into it during quarantine cus i had nothing better to do😭
lmao yess
edgy era fr
i remember memorizing the name of bands and stuff
LMAOOOO IM DEAD
it was such a weird time
just waiting for somebody to ask name 3 bands and boom you have 10
right
wasn't that the same time bts got big?
i think so
honestly i remember 8th grade as the time when i think onision was big and so was shane dawson and like that era of youtubers
omg not themmm
i knowww and i knew people who watched them religiously
girl i think my homegirl had a hoodie from him like😭😭😭
honestly i also remember there being some kind of weirdly popular wattpad fic about brendon urie's forehead or something
what LMAO
yeah i dont remember that at all😭😭😭
probably my friend group then
maybe
but i remember they were big on twenty one pilots, fall out boy, my chemical romance, pierce the veil, falling in reverse, black veil brides, sleeping with sirens, panic at the disco, bring me the horizon and like other screamo bands
omg twenty one pilots HAHA
i used to be big on them in 8th grade 😭
yeah they were so popular back then
fr like i remember stressed out and ride and i think heavydirtysoul
it was so weird hearing p!atd on the radio like years later
literally tho like ??????
honestly some of the people haven't aged at all
no fr like i saw one of my old classmates on ig one time and she’s the same as she was in middle school just older💀
she’s been a egirl so ahead of her time??? idfk
lmaooooo
honestly that's so wild
fr like it’s either people have a 180 or stay the same lowk
i've just been about the same height since middle school i think
and yeahhhhhhhhh
lmao felt tho
5’2 gang🥴
and now all the children i knew grew
so they call me short
felt😭😭😭
and then i end up being like offended short person noises
i'm 5'3
we almost the same im just an inch off HAHAHA
my brother likes to spite me and say i'm 5'2.5 he just really had to take that half an inch off me
i get that all the time😭😭
most of the people i meet are taller than me and then they're like wow you're short
and i'm like wow you're tall
i had all the chances to be taller lowk cus my mom made me take growing medicine and all but i don’t sleep
5'2 gang 😭
okay but felt
yessssssssss
the struggle 😩😩😩
okay but same
also hi i dont want to sleep
i drank this weird herbal concoction and hit 5'3

gn streaks🤝
umaaaaaaaaaa how has your day been?
its been pretty good! what about you?
it's been long ahahahah but i'm having fun
spis was pretty much all day today because of game night
i singlehandedly managed to get this chat live so i'm happy
yayyyy
fr fr  it was pretty much all day
i had to leave early though
it's been so nice to actually talk to people
and see faces
because i wanted to bake cookies haha
yes its so refreshing
ohhhhhhhhhh niceeee
what kind
of cookies
snickerdoodles!!
ohhhhhhhhh those are greattttttttt :3
yeah theyre my favorite
i feel like i've been deprived of social interactions for so long that now i'm overly social
i have forgotten how to talk to new peopl e
like usually i'm not this talkative
SAME
because of lockdown
but i also just don't know how to talk to people
so i get anxious about starting a convo
yeah me toooo
and then i do it anyway because idk
its bc im an introvert
a quiet chat always kinda bugs me
i blame the guild i joined in a game
oohh what game
same, i'm probably an ambivert leaning towards introvert
me too
it's shining nikki!
i havent heard of it
it's a newer game from the love nikki series
i kinda started on a whim
i think ive seen ads for that
but the guild has a discord activity requirement so i started chatting and then i couldn't stop
im so bad at games though
same
i play all the easy games
i tried playing genshin because all my friends were playing
like animal crossing pocket camp?
OMG GENSHINNNNNNNN
i was so bad
but i gave up at the first temple
i couldn't pass that hang glider thingy
me too omg
i died like thirty times and gave up
i couldnt figure out how to get it to work
its so frustrating
yesssssssssssssssssss
i also play fate grand order
ive heard of that toooo
but mostly it's my brother who grinds for me while i collect the characters i want
ahahah
i think one of my friends plays it
honestly i like just watching people play video games
yeah same its entertaining
i also like not having to do anything lmao
its a lot less frustrating when someone else is doing all the work
i was watching a few different streams of resident evil 8 and honestly it was amazing
yeah!!!!
instead you just enjoy the game while they struggle with the stuff
exactly
i ended up finding some favorite streamers through that ahahah
which streamers do you watch
corpse_husband mainly ahahahah
hes super popular
yeahhhhhh his voice is really soothing for me
ive seen some of his streams
i got into him b/c of the resi 8 stream
i used to watch his horror videos a long time ago
i thought it was hilarious
ohhhh that is so cool
i dont think ive seen that one but maybe i should
he did two
ohh cool
his first was capcom sponsored
and then he did another one
but he didn't finish the game yet
hopefully he'll do more
i also follow the main singer from this smaller band that i like on twitch
i havent heard of them maybe ill check them out
do you have any favorite shows
i have a bunch
i have a long list of animes i loved
and then i have regular tv shows
and then the ones in a different language
i just finished fruits basket and now idk what to do with my life
haikyuu is great if you haven't seen that yet
ive seen the first season i need to keep up with it
i personally loved darling in the franxx, but it's also one of those that not everyone likes
i thought that how to keep a mummy was great
tanaka-kun is always listless is pretty great
ill definitely check those out
assassination classroom is a popular one that was pretty good
yeah i heard that one was pretty good
i mean do you have any personal preferences
i will warn you that ditf has some minor nudity
i havent seen any anime in a long time but i started watching again recently
heaven's design team is a new one that is pretty good
i saw clips of it and it was pretty great
that time i reincarnated as a slime is also a great anime
i just looked up heavens design team and the animation is so pretty
way of the househusband is hilarious
it really issssss
maybe ill watch that next
im so bad at finishing shows though
sameeeeeee
i started and stopped this jmedical drama so many times i-
i need to finish watching hunterxhunter
i heard that one's pretty goodddddd
yeah i can never finish dramas
oh that reminds me bungou stray dogs is pretty good
my friend really likes that one
i read an obscene amount of manga once online school started
how do u read it without getting a virus lmao
mangadex or bato.to
all the sites have so many pop ups and adblock doesnt work 😭
some scans teams also made their own sites after mangadex went down for maintenance
i heard those two closed
mangadex is adless and bato.to has some i think
mangadex died for a few months but it's back and running
oh thats good
i didnt know that
lmaooo i was using mangadex to read and track what i was reading so i found out all that stuff
ahahah
i had like manhwas, manhuas, and mangas all in there
yeah mangadex has everything
pretty much!!! they even have some doujins
not a bunch
but some
i used to read it more in the beginning of high school
i started reading cause i didn't have time to watch lmao
i always end up reading wayy too much so then when people ask, i have a ton of recs
i think thats a good thing though
lmaooooo
i always start a lot but dont finish any
i do the same thing with stuff on ao3
and then i cant tell people if theyre good or not
lmaoooo a lot of what i read is in progress
but honestly it could be a good thing you don't finish
sometimes you get so invested that you forget to do everything else
thats trueeee
its distracting
there were a couple times where i stayed up wayyy too late reading
i hate it when youre waiting for the next chapter
sameee
but it's also so bad when you're 100 chapters behind or something
then it feels overwhelming
i was around 200 chapters behind, if not more on tower of god
and i wasted like three days reading it all
im so behind on tower of god
and then i stopped reading months later
the story is so complicated though
idk whats happening anymore
honestly god of high school was the same
at first i was so hyped
i havent read that one
and then it got too long
lookism ended up with the same problem
yeah and the auhtor went on a break so i really dont remember anythingggg
wait umaaaaaa
have you read gourmet hound?
yes!!! omg its my favorite
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh it's so sweet i-
Omg u guys are talking this is so cool
yeah i started a conversation at like 10pm
Danggg
it was a whim kind of decision
im just not sleepy
Where do u guys read manga?
i joined half an hour ago
i usually stay up way too late
i usually recommend bato.to or mangadex
webtoon has some too
and i have one chinese app for literally one manhua
Noted
i have randomly been checking chat like every 20 minutes
but it's really good
gourmet hound was good
i talk a lot
yesssss gourmet hounddddd
yess it was so sweet
the ending was so good
have any of u read its a good day to be a dog
yesssssssssss
that one was cute
the author did please take care of me in my 19th life too
yayyy omg and the author has a new series
and it's sadddddd
yeahhh
i love ittt
mercenary enrollment is bloody but good
is that by the same author
no
a new one
ooohh ok ill add it to my list
it's a rising one on webtoon, just started getting translated
but there's one done by asura scans or reapers scans that i really love
is it on canvas or an original
i read like lookism weak hero and wind breaker if anyone knows those
original
ohhh lookismmmmmmmmmm
lookism is sooo long
read way more webtoons in like fresh/soph year
i got into webtoon this past year
yall my parents made me get off for an hour and so much has happened 😩
hardcore leveling warrior was good but i just kinda lost interest
yeah i really can't stop talking ahahahah
her mannequin has pretty art
have u read kubera
no
its pretty good but it gets complicated
ive only read true beauty like a lot of ppl but its been months since ive gone on lmao
eleceed is really cuteeeeeeeee
there are cats
i tried reading true beauty but i didnt like it as much
i stopped reading after a while for that one as well
it was the love triangle thing that made me stop
i got frustrated with the love triangle
sameeee
i got annoyed at the mc after a bit
yesssss
yeahhh
wait have any of you read men of the harem or remarried empress
and i watched the drama so i was like wtv i wont catch up
is the drama better
i know it got really popular
hmmm lowkey everyone shipped her w seojun for the drama but :///
the ending was really wonky
strongest florist is pretty great
started remarried empress cause friends recommended but i didn't rly get into it
but it did make me laugh a lot
i need to catch up on remarried empress
oh it's hard to get into, definitely
path of the shaman is a manhwa that's not officially licensed yet but it was great
o wait aerin whats the one chinese manhua youre into?
usually i like stuff thats more slice-of-life than romance which is why i think i prefer gourmet hound type reads
scream queen on bilibili
ah that sounds familiar but i dont know it
suitor armor is pretty great
oo is gourmet hound good? i think it's on my list but i kinda have a long list now
yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
it's amazing
yes its really good
hmm maybe ill redownload the app and see if i have time to read it :))
i rarely keep up with the mangas or manhwas now
oh has anyone read blue period
after i started watching shows this year bc of boredom and 2nd sem senioritis i havent really done much else-
only manga ive read in like the past 2 years
but its super good
not too long either
no, i haven't
guys sleeping is base
lmao i'll probably have to go to sleep sometime in the next hour or so
buuuuuuuuuut
until then
my sleep schedule hasnt gotten much better
so every morning i have to draggg myself out of bed
yeah mine is messed up
before spis i was waking up at 11 everyday
ahahahah i kept telling myself this week i'd go to bed early so i could wake up and get good sleep before class
i went to bed at 1 am and woke at 7-8 am
it wasn't good sleep
thats still early wow
s a m  e
i've gotten five hours most days this week lol
w h y
me too because im so used to sleeping late
i think my latest wake up time this summer was like 2-3 which is way better than last summer
i ask despite having pulled an all-nighter to see what it was like
yeah same and sometimes i cant even fall asleep til 4-5 when i try to sleep early lol
all nighters are not fun
^
me too
all nighters are sometimes fun
i knew a few insomniacs
amogus
so i got curious
amogus
well depends on your definition of an all nighter bc some people call it one if you sleep after lik 5-6 am
ethan ur epic
full 24 hours
no sleep
that ones not fun
i am 😎
yeahhhhh it's not
i was so out of it it wasn't even funny
i also knew someone who had a caffeine overdose so now i know the symptoms for that
oh no
i didnt know that was a thing
it was our mutual classmate's fault
my friend gave him money to buy some trader joe's cold brew for them and then the guy went and bought two giant bottles of the concentrated type
OH
which my friend drank despite the fact you're supposed to dilute that
yeah
yikes
those things are very intense
yeah!!! for sure
i handle caffeine poorly
yeah i dont drink caffeine
how did your friend drink that all without realizing tho-
dude just wanted to be awake
that i don't know lmao
its so bitter and like thickckk
sam, focus on the amogus
:amogus:
lmao what are u doing
secret
idk how people drink coffee black
oh yeah we have two spots if people are interested
ikr
it's so bitter
i used to say black coffee was better but i literally only drank it in elem/middle school
now i just stay away
i think the only time i've heard of someone having black coffee that seemed feasible was affogato
wait elementary/middle school?
yeah i used to drink it in middle school
my parents wouldn't let me touch that stuff
because i was always sleepy
i had to search that but it looks good :o
they said it would make me short
i think it made me short
im shorter 😭
yeah i blame it on the coffee
although they say that's also my disordered eating & messed up sleep schedule
i barely drank it but still
ah yeah that too!
i think its also because i went vegan in middle school LMAO
my brother had coffee when he was a child
and he's taller than me
sad moment
and i could never go vegan
vegetarian sure
i lasted 6 months
then i gave up
i remember going to some chinese school on saturdays
i did that too
and every year they'd try to convince us kids to go vegetarian
cause they were buddhist
oh interesting i wonder if it worked on people
not as far as i know
lol they tried 😩
i love butter chicken too much
they also tried to convert us and make us pray
butter chicken is amazing
yesss
sorry herbivores ;-;
ive only had butter chicken once and it was on pizza lol
nooo u have to have it with curry and naan
did you guys go to this school knowing it was religious tho
its soo good
never had butter chicken
ahhh u have to try it
maybe one day but im so picky hehe
i have no clue, it was a taiwanese organization that my parents registered me for
mood
either way i stopped after sixth grade
but i used to cause so much trouble there
wait i think i literally quit chinese school in 6th too...
the coincidences
yessssssss
so now i'm almost illiterate in chinese ahahahahah
yeah my parents were so disapponted when i did chinese 1 freshman year LOLL
i use google translate so i can read
i started from 1 so i did ap last year and i got into chinese entertainment so now my mandarin is slightly ok but i cant read or write anyways
me too!!
i can read pinyin and usually understand it well enough
i can't understand pinyin sometimes
but i can understand old people talking cause my relatives talk in chinese all the time
although i probably understand more taiwanese over chinese
ah i only know casual lingo not the fancy stuff
omg really i wanna learn taiwanese but idk how... my parents used to just speak it so my sis and i wouldnt understand
most of my older relatives speak it
so i picked it up pretty fast cause i was pretty much the only child among the elderly
but sometimes they speak at me in taiwanese and i get all confused cause they think i know more than i do
mhm whenever i visit relatives some speak to me in taiwanese and im like ......
i know like 5 phrases max
oml i was so bad when i went to taiwan two or three years ago
i just spoke english the whole time
thats usually me anyways :') oops
i can speak some taiwanese, enough to converse
but usually i don't and i'm apparently not supposed to
mainly cause my cousins on my mom's side don't speak it ig?
ahh that would make sense but its still so cool
so it's just weird if i'm speaking taiwanese or using taiwanese phrases when they don't
not that i don't
i used to mix taiwanese and chinese soooooo much
unfortunately i can only chinglish but yeah i always feel so americanized whenever i reply to ppl in eng and they speak in chinese
that's a joy luck club moment i swear
my mom always lectures me in chinese but i speak english i-
oh yeah i didnt even realize that our family convos are always 2 languages bc i got so used to it
and on a random note uhhh whats this girlboss cult in these peoples statuses LOL
right?
idk what it is
i am not part of the cult
girlboss
yall girlboss
lol i just noticed that
my status is just a cat
cause cats
ive just been invisible the past 2 months
hiding from some servers
ahahahah i did invisible for a bit but couldn't stand it
i just do dnd cause i'm in a bunch of servers so i get notifs all day
bc of pings?
and i hear the noises
omg yeah
i mute discord
i got discord recently and im still trying to figure out how to use it
plus you can sometimes hear the discord notifs in the background of your zoom
can we pretend that airplanes ✈️  in the night sky 🌠  are like sharks 🦈  killed by country music 🎸
i used to be perma dnd but now i just mute the tab so sometimes during lab hrs im like... i cant hear anything...
there was this one dude in my class who would talk and there would be just the sound of discord notifs
interesting lyrics
girlboss grindset never stops
oh for sure that happened so much this year
girlboss grindset never stops
is this a cult
people didnt care anymore
yall take your cult away
ironically the notifs were messages from people telling him to turn on dnd
LMAO
i swear no one paid any attention in class
ok some people would do that and there are those bold ones that unmute before answering a question and you just hear them googling it frantically
i did absolutely nothing in most of my classes
same same
this is HILARIOUS
i didn't even read some of my required reading
yeah senior year was rough
im actually annoyed that i did better on ap tests this year bc theye basically didnt matter
my econ/us history was like free period
oh i didnt read a single book
oops
i was supposed to read dracula, couldn't  get interested
and pretty much only used the book for quotes
it became such a norm in my physics class and our teacher was so oblivious
my professors & teachers never really called on people
ok our lit class read king lear OUT LOUD during class for 2 weeks straight and i couldnt even name a single thing that happened because i would read the assigned parts brainlessly
hmmm strange
i didn't have to read any shakespeare besides hamlet
thats a classic ive never read it before tho
the rest of my year was short stories
i honestly made things up for practically every essay i had
that seems more fun, we had so many poems and stuff and i really cannot analyze them
me too i did pretty badly on a lot of my essays but somehow did ok on the ap test *apparently*
i used to have to write art analysis critiques in my art class at high school so i got used to making things up
my english 1b professor really thought i had reading comprehension issues
but i didn't actually read dracula and therefore had no idea what happened in the plot
but since she explained what happened, i wrote an essay that she thought was perfect
it was that bad
thats a good skill
so now my brain is just mush
i was only good at that a few years ago but im pretty sure i got worse or teachers got harder to trick :((
i actually hope i dont go insane when in person school starts
i honestly don't know how i do it, but i have yet to encounter a teacher who finds my writing abilities bad
oml sameeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
i feel like i'm just going to be losing my mind when school starts
i only just got used to socializing again
lol my 1-th grade teacher hated my writign and i was offended til i realized that all my earlier teachers only cared about grammar/spelling and not content
me too
i cannot socialize in person for my life tho
(i think)
its been too long
earlier in the summer when everyone got their acceptances and were reaching out to make friends i got a handful of dms
and i really froze up and freaked out
i was like wtf am i supposed to do and i was soooo awkward
oh i just didnt talk in much but yeahh i dmed some ppl about rooming and i felt SO AWK
i got dmed a bunch and i was like 0-0
sometimes i panic before replying and i just forget to reply and i realize a month later and im bashing my head like-
o wow did you post an intro on something?
yeah i had one in revelle 2025 & one on the big ucsd.25 one
idr the thing anymore
i was also in the loopchat & patio
and a few snapchat gcs
ohh yeah im in the ucsd25 one but i barely talked
are any of u majoring in cog sci
i mean i'm also in the discord but i rarely chat there
YES
uma
and i think i joined loopchat/patio too late and my anxiety- i just cant speak in giant gcs
i am
yess
ME TOOO
same
:OO
oml i just got tired of the loopchat and the patio
wait were all majoring in cog sci
yessss
in one of them i kept getting an at everyone ping
yayyyyyyyyyy cognitive scienceeeeeeeeeeeee
oh no those can get so annoying
wait what colleges are you all in
i'm in revelle
idk what specialization to pick
im in sixth
im in erc :((( idk anyone
ohhh nicee
me too... idk when i should decide
sameeee
i'm doing ml
i also have no idea if ill like cogsci bc i dont know about it
im thinking ml or design
oo nice i was just concerned that i wouldnt be able to get a lot of the classes
yeah since it overlaps
i think all i really have left are upper division courses and like the cogsci specific ones
yeah and cs is very competitive lol
i think i'm sophomore standing? idr
are there more cs classes in upper division
yeah
im technically sophomore standing but most my ap scores dont do anything for grad
because i was looking at the plans thing and there were almost none in lower division
i have 90 units so i have like 90 left
oh wow
90???
crazu
thats a lot
sheesh, and I thought i was ballin with 56
yeah i did middle college for 11th & 12th
you could double major in 3 years i you wanted i swear
nah
my brain would fry itself
yeah def dont overwork yourself
i might take a minor though
gosh that sounds like a lot to pile on for these 2 years tho
oh yeah you know how the plan says dsgn 1 or cogs 10 for first quarter? i didnt even see those courses on the website for this quarter so idk if im going crazy
i had a few classmates who completed an aa
i want to take cogs 1
yeah it's one or the other
i haven't checked course catalog yet, though i should
oh i literally dont know anyone who did middle college so im not sure how it works
i thought it recommended cogs 1 for second quarter but im not sure why...
its like being a full time community college student and a full time high school student
might be because it's only offered then
some classes are like that
its in fall quarter though so im not sure
it could also be in winter
yeah it was strange the one i thought i could take didnt seem like it was offered
well i think you can swap it out unless i'm wrong
ack 2 full times at a time seems so hard
but those are all considered ge
it actually wasn't
i had 2 high school classes and 3 college classes
i also took like 3 classes at another community college
my classmates who did aas took classes at the community college we all attended and did more at deanza or something to get their aa
so they're junior standing
oh only 2 hs classes? idk why i thought youd need like 6-5 hs classes + more cc ones
lmaooooo nahhh that would be wayy too crazy
thats insane to think about tho
yeah i was like sjfuieguoings yall do you but i could never
i honestly thought it was kinda fun
i took one cc class ever and i was already annoyed at adding another class to my schedule lmao
i got to pick my class times
so it was niceeeeee
ohhhh thats nice
no mandatory 8 am
yep!
and i remember being so hyped about real cadavers in human bio
eek
not my type of thing LOL
i could never be a doctor
i mean i saw a cadaver at 14 so it wasn't that surprising
oh same
i can''t
it was just exciting
the sight of blood makes me sooo squeamish already
me tooo
same and then i remember the kids at the doctor's office whenever i go
and i shudder
people are just like ... at me whenever i get surprised by it lol thats also why i dont watch horror
i get so scared and then i watch it anyway
technically, resi 8 scares me
i dont think ive ever watched a horror movie
but i watch it even though i jump at everything
i watched it and i was afraid for a really long time
the only horror game i think ive seen is dead by daylight lmao my friends made me play for a few days
ohhh i saw that game in a stream
but nope i still stay away from watching scary games
i dont think ive watched too much tho bc i hate the squelch noises
i had friends who liked silent hill and the pt
and the pt really scared me
i havent even heard of those
silent hill is really scary ngl
oh it's a playstation horror game series
they were discontinued back in 2017 i think
like the series
ok even phasmophobia makes me jump so i dont think i could deal with actual scary games 😩
ah yeah i definitely didnt know of any games back then lol
lmaooo
totally fair
i wouldn't have known about it either tbh
but man it was creepy
i don't understand how people don't find things scary
my english teacher was like that
yeah when i spend time watching stuff i just wanna relax and not deal with that
he would go to haunted houses where you had to sign a waiver for the experience y'know of getting scared by random people who were paid to scare you
and he was like meh
thats ppl @ me whenever i shriek seeing a spider lmaoo
oml i do too
i scream when i see a bug
ah tbh those people scare me bc they dont get scared LOL
me tooo
my friends clown me sometimes
i was out walking during a summer program and i saw a bug
i let out a screech of sheer terror
but i was fine when i saw a snake
ahhhh i had this one classmate who tried to chase me around with a worm
ahflfhdasf
wait yeah same as long as the snake isnt about to bite me im fine w it
yuck
honestly i hope my suitemates aren't scared of bugs too
otherwise who are we going to call
i used to not be scared of bugs in elem and i would go digging for worms or some nasty stuff like that
man guts of steel
i swear
omg i was talking to a potential roomie and she said she despised bugs and i was like OH NO
it was all so simple when we were kids
that's one of my requirements ngl
literally! i used to throw tantrums when my parents didnt let me kill the spiders LMAOOO and now spiders are my #1 fear like what happened
like i'm afraid of bugs, the other party can''t be as well
ahhhhhhhhhhh
same
i used to be meh spiders
shoot i didnt ask my roomie how she was w bugs uhhh hope itll be fine
now i'm like panicked screaming
i just tell myself its a good growing experience but ew no thanks
i refuse to touch a bug without gloves on
i need to protect myself
what kind of horror did spiders do to us though?? i cant even rememeber
i jus dont
i think i just got creeped out by their movement
true its ominous
i'm so strict about not having to deal with bugs ahahahah
i don't want to have to touch them cause scary
which is exactly why i need to find people who are okay with them
i just shriek and hope theres someone around who can deal with it
i had a friend who's gonna be at uc berkeley who was great with bugs
i didnt ask my roomie bc we both were going to go random and decided last minute to just put each other lol
wish she came here with me ;w;
then i could live with less fear
aww yeah fr
i can name 1 friend im sure is fine w bugs but tbh other people are usually ok with them
and they dont overreact
i mean i met some people who can't handle cockroaches
and no
i will not handle those
i will scream and leave
those things look NASTY
i cant
i hate that they can fly
i hate it
kejfnhiauegbeuhigidebjhebugaerg
thinking about it is
no
omg the people who take pictures of bugs and post them also annoy me
AHHH one of my friends does that and specifically sends me vids of spiders
he knows i hate it
bc once we were on zoom and i saw one on my bed and flipped
omg that kind of person would get blocked
i get so scared when i see bugs
i would but unfortunately probaly shouldnt lmaoo
true true
and it was more of a last summer thing so i used to be wary and barely look at the screen
my friends just send me cat pictures
ooooo
i literally beg all my friends w cats to send lmao
only one person sends me like one pic every week tho
so disappointing
ahahah i send my friend cat posts and then they send me some too
my friend once sent me a video of a cat and said that the cat reminded them of me
it was really random
oh? sometimes the vibes just match and it cant be explained lmaoo
trueeeeeeeeeeeee
i used to be on cat/dog tiktok so that was a fun time but i stopped opening the app so now i just rely on random snaps
my friend and i have even characterized ourselves as cats for whatever reason
i never got tiktok
my insta sends me tons of cats
and food
but cats
for some reason this just reminds me of warrior cats idk why lmao
good on you for not getting that app lol i was forced to but i only used it for a month or so and it def wasnt straight tiktok
my friend told me i had the personality of a ragdoll cat lmao
i just dont go on insta enough for it to do that :'(
i just followed a bunch of tags
i mean like at least 50
hmm those are cute i dont actually know cat personalitites tho lmao
and there were a bunch of cat tags ig
o wow
i was bored ngl
i didnt even realize you could follow tags uhhh im very behind on insta tech
i mean i groan whenever i get insta notifs
<.<
cat
awwwwwwjiaweie
catttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
omg i wanna pet
it's so cuteeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
sameeee
litearlly adorablee!!!
LOOK AT THAT TUMMY

im already in love
sam your cat is so cuteeeeeeeeeeeeeee
can we make a pet pic channel or something
Y E S
i want
d o g
aaaaaaaaaa
awwwww
okay like there's a pet pic channel in the 2025 discord
cookie is my favorite dog thank you ethan
but it's not enoughhhhhh
wait can we actually just make one under game night lmao
thank you, she is my favorite dog too
yeah that's cause of the perms
cookie thte dog thats adorable
but idk if we're actually allowed to since it is the game night cateogry
sadly true
i feel like they wouldnt care that much? but i dont wanna
hmmmm idk where to ask lmfao
but i also think no one is free to be indulging us for things like this at 1am
i bet any of the mentors would do it
true
it's okay we can just spam this place
im loving this
and then ask for one tomorrow ahahah
true but its so hard to scroll back and find them if i wanted to ahahah
i wish i had a pet
i only have a pet brother
me but im slightly allergic to cats
awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
AWKHHGHHHG
lol pet brother sounds uhhh entertaining hopefulyl
lmaooo he's helpful
younger>?
he grinds my mobile games for me
yes
omg LOL
we love that
y e s
do you have siblings?
also watch everyone see this tomorrow and be like wtf
tb to the days i used to set an alarm to do some hourly free things on games idek
yeahh i have an older sister!
ohhh cool!!!!!!!
theyll just see 50+ messages unless they try to scroll lmaoo
mhm shes helpful for my uhhh boba obsession :D
lmaooooooooo
boba is sooooooo good
what's the flavor you usually get?
everyone knows i love it bc perhaps my pfp
lmaooooooooooo
hmm depends on my mood or where but my go to is either jasmine gmt or some fruit gt
never fruit and milk
just isnt it
taro's my personal favorite tbh
i grew up drinking that flavor specifically
:o i actually dont think ive ever gotten it bc i dont usually like taro in other thigns
honestly i hope that by the end of five weeks, this chat is actually more active ahahahah
oh the taro isn't like actual taro usually
they have this taro powder
i feel like it will be? esp if you keep starting it up 😌 lmao
oh true its all artificial LOL
i've had actual taro and it was flavorless
my mom also once blended taro and put in some boba pearls
and that was traumatic
ive only had powdered taro milk tea my mom got at a store and it wa alright but the purple color a lot of places have also kinda throws me off lol
oh no
that douesn sound too good
ahahaha i guess i'll have to be the catalyst
not that i mind
my mom has made "boba" out of taro and otherboba things and you cant rly taste it so its alright
i usually end up starting a bunch of conversations in a different server i'm in
maybe! or epopel will realize that this chat isnt dead and talk
Y E S i hope for that
its always weirder if its not normally too active and you try to start it
because i'm also v awkward
yessssssssss
i tried for like 2 days ish? maybe?
idk
you dont seem awk but maybe thats my awk self speaking ahahahah
:o
finally figured it out ahahahah
yayyyy congrats!!
i think there was only one server i used to be active in but then strange "drama" happend and thats why im always invis now LOL
i had a lot of practice from the other server since it's a guild server for a game where i have an activity req
to think i used to start convos somehow-
ahh make ssense
i know some of the massive servers have really active chats
but i can't handle those cause you only meet people for what, five minutes?
with those, i feel like you just pop in a bit and never go back again
or its a complete other group
yep!!!!!
i definitely wouldnt remember people oops
although the kny server i'm in had a hilarious shrine for a once extremely active member of their server
and the funniest part was that the guy's username was inosuke
omg i remember once i was kinda active on a sub only channel thing but i lost the sub and forgot everyone i talked to so those were sad hours
so for a while i thought they worshipped inosuke
idk anime references 😭
awwwwwwwwwwww that's sadddd
lmaooo he was a character
i thought they worshipped him
turns out it wasn't a cult
honestly most of the way i've been comprehending life since lockdown has been haikyuu
oh? lolll sometimes i see usernames and i just subconsciously relate them to tother ppl or things and i get confused when i realize it isnt related
ok so many ppl love haikyuu i should really try to get into it but idkkk
same! i saw someone with the username iwa and immediately thought of haikyuu
one of my friends even put it in her college intro bio thing even tho she didnt finish it LMAO she said she had to do research when ppl started dming her afhiuigjkebrgreg
haikyuu is pretty fun and wholesome
the fandom is crazyyy big though
isnt it long tho? i feel like i woudlnt be able to finish
i think i started in 8th grade
oh yeah i swear everyone knows it lol
i think if you're new, the anime might be easier to do over the manga
the manga is finished but there are around 200 chaps
i mean i love the manga sooooooo
but yeah
oh gosh
im definitely a binge watcher/reader
the anime has four seasons + the side season
so far
so that wouldnt be good for my uhhh sleep schedule and education esp since school is starting soon and spis lmao
ahhh thats why i used to not watch any tv ever i always thought it was too much dedication
sameeeeeeee
that's how i ended up reading manga
and well i couldn't stop myself from reading wayyy too much
but there are a bunch of different fandom related jokes that you end up understanding afterwards ig
so there's that
i used to be an avid reader til hs started but yearh i would read til the sun came up if it was a long book/series and i would get in trouble lol
ok true i love understanding references
makes me feel in the loop
ahahahah the only person who probably consistently would make those references might be me ahahah
but its also a lot to actually get into it so i just dont do anything most the time
yeah it really takes a lot of time and effort
oh no ill just have to be confused each time then-
i think i brought up a couple of older references that had people dying
ok but that feeling is great
it's funny how i can't remember what i did yesterday, but i remember most everything from haikyuu
afknkdjfnsdansd literally me too but with other fandoms(?) or just things i strangely got into and know too much about
but my memory is too bad i cant actually name these things til it comes up
yeah!!! like i know a little too much about a bunch of discord bots
and i also know how to make a webhook
oh wow like what bots?
i still have 0 clue what that is
mainly moderation bots like mee6, tatsu, yagpdb, dyno but also some of the reaction role bots as well
that is so relatable aerin
idk what i ate for lunch but i can tell you so many random things
i turned on dev mode back in 9th grade and never turned it off
mind you the reason why i turned on dev mode was not good reasons
oo i used to be rly involved in mee6 or random reaction role things but then i gave up and other moddy ppl could do stuff
oh?
my friend was really annoyed by some kid and decided to try to get their ip from the discord account
who hasn’t tried to do that tho
but since they had a steam linked we actually did find the location :p
...me?
i only have dev mode for ids i think and idk how to do anything else w it
oh
STALKER ALERT
dev mode is useful for a bunch of stuff
i guess were abnormal oop
just be thankful yall weren't around in the skype era cause you could get someone's ip so easily 😭
my parents used to use skype to call relatives
i used skype for a good month and gave up 😭
skype era should be thankful i wasnt around <3
i dislike skype
ahaha same
i have a bad habit of googling too well
SAME
omg i wanna log in now bc i think i had old convos with some ppl i havent heard of in years
sometimes people ask me how i know things and i just say it was a search
and then they give me the surprised pikachu face
it’s all on the internet yk???
y e a h
i love google
litearlly!
the internet will also tell you i'm smart and i understand cs
don't buy it
it's a lie
bet it isnt!
u seem smart
you have no idea
yepp
i’ve bought it
oh well
i am buying it rn
you cannot stop me
no returns after purchase
aerin is officially smart
it took me seven hours to understand what i was supposed to do in step 3 of lab 2
how is that smart
i read it ten times and didn't understand it
cant gaslight gatekeep girlboss out of this one aerin is certified smart
i don't even know what that means
it sounds like you figured it out now
oh
which means you're now smarter than you were before!
i dont think i did it the right way
that is true josh
false, you can gaslight gatekeep girlboss your way out of anything
this is the one exception
but yeah, google makes me sound smart and accomplished cause i'm credited in some paper for cs
but i actually knew nothing about what we were doing
:ooo
:ooooo
what is this paper
:oooooooo
*google time*
send paper
you won't find it
i use my middle name not my legal first name ahahah
lAme
rip
:p
boooo
yeah it said no great matches :RollEyes:
time to do some strange dev mode stuff to... find middle name?
no this is my middle name
lmfao
not my first name :p
OH
i read it the wrong way
your name is so cool either way tho!!
lmfao
is it really that interesting?
yessehh
i think i really like ae in names
i only realized this recently
lmao i do too
my friend was the one who picked it for me :p
like my friend aera 😍 and the name mae
i didn't have a middle name until now
oh thats so cool
yeah!!!!
is it a new thing for college then?
yep
cause i'm tired of my original name :p
now im more curious 😩
also cause it lets me separate people i meet from relatives
fine i'll drop it lmfao
https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03800
if someone understands what i was doing/supposed to do
please ping me because i still don't know
wait thats why i asked my friend if she knew you earlier and she said she didnt LOL
wdym?
> Reducing latency and bandwidth for video streaming using keypoint extraction and digital puppetry
oh lmao
i just found it
i didn't title it
haven’t been watching chat
do you know annie lee btw from school
ohhhhhhhhhhh her
i knew her
i met her a few times
we were in cross country together for a year
wait how lmfao
oh i completely forgot she ran but yeah i think i asked her if she knew an aerin and she was like nope
mm google
yeah no, the people from prospect knew me from my original name ahahahah
maeks sense
omg googled your name
THAT PIC IS GORGEOUS
i-
why
her linkedin pic is so fire
i also haven't updated it cause lazyyyyy
Send it
and it's wayyyy too much work
send what
i-
what
ikr!! also love that it pops up at the top
The pic
i don't know why it pops up at the top
youre famousss
uh nooooooo
i had almost no social life in high school
well i guess that doesnt relate to google becuase youre up there :o
lmfao
and its ok college is a fresh start wooo
but i doubt i can make myself more social-\
yeah i told myself i'd actually try to be social
guess it worked, i blame my ~~cult~~ i mean new guild
yay its so hard for me irl tho
i keep telling myself i'll run out of things to say, and then i don't because my midnight brain always comes up with something weird
oh night convos are the best
i actually liked irl social interactions, i could walk away
you can kinda go crazy but its so normal
i feel trapped in some online convos, esp when they're private cause i've had people private message me and be creepy
soooo
oh whattt i feel like walking away is easier online if you rly wanted to
nah i like physically walking away, i think it makes the message clearer
ok true uhhh ive gotten strange dms but i never reply unless i know them enough
i got messaged by some dude who i didn't know on snap and we were in the same ucsd group chat
for me my convos irl are usually w ppl i "know" so it feels too rude to just leave
and i got weird vibes
eek
and then turns out he was also messaging another friend of mine in the same gc
and he asked to call with her despite us all only meeting for the first time that day
uhhh giant red flags!
then when i refused to give him my insta, he really stalked me and found me and shamelessly sent me a follow request
so i blocked him on both accounts :p
Bruh
nice block
lmfaooooo
some ppl need to just
that makes me think of haikyuu
think? take a hint? be normaler?
i mean his insta was really weird too
one of my other friends insta stalked him and he had really weird posts about blades and murder?
i don't remember exactly, but it was creepy
ummm im concerned
hopefully i never encounter him
s a m e
i will zoom away
this is another reason sometimes i justify my hermit life
why did i imagine you logging on to zoom i think my brain is frying
i honestly got really lonely and bored during the whole zoom life
ahahah i was in track and cross country two years ago
i assume i can run fast enough to get out of a bad situation
though i've never tried
ive never had to but i need to do smth about my health
s a me
30 sec of walking makes me tired already
oh i can tolerate walking for a long time
my heart rate is alrd kinda abnormal perhaps because i havent moved
there have been a number of occasions where my family has gotten lost so at this point i'm just like sure whatever
i think my walking is getting better lmao but i definitely gotta work on survival skills
ahahahahahahah
honestly though i'm so used to seeing people's pfps that when i see real faces i always end up surprised
my health app was a good 100 steps daily average for the majority of each month and thats really not it
i feel like that's the same for me
oh my gosh that would be me because i imagine people with their pfps if i talk to them a lot online
i guess people get all shocked that i don't look like tendou satori
LMAO
it's also weird whenever people find my linkedin and the kinda know me and someone messages me with ur pretty
like pls no
maybe i look like boba tbh a good percentage of me might be that anyways
ahahahahah
my linkedin is still not pfped oops
i don't know why i did but i did
oops definitely didnt say that earlier :D
i actually despise pictures usually
Perfect, that’s why my pfp is my fave
Face
ahahah
ethan ill just expect you to look like that 24/7
oml trueeee
i mean some people have really cute pfps
wont recognize a normal expression
josh's pfp is lovely
Of course, I am in a constant state of despair
y e s
it is
honestly animal pfps are usually the best
but i also really have a soft spot for the haikyuu ones as well
especially the ones from the manga
:oo guess we'll see on zoom on monday
ahahahahahah
lol i dont think ive seen pics of ppl using references i actually know yet
i honestly found a bunch of zoom backgrounds
so i keep swapping them
i usually try to match with whatever i'm wearing and it's kind of a game now
i mean i have yet to see farmer ushijima or deadchi
omg i finally got a laptop last month and i never had the option for legit zoom backgrounds so i havent used any yet
i keep playing with them
oh now i gotta pay attention to that :p
i also end up stretching a lot ahahha
my inner cat is like stretchy stretchy time
i dont even know what i do i just assume im not on anyone's screen 😩
ahahahaha
:kitty:
my anxiety makes me hyper aware
especially since once i was unmuted and i told my brother to shut up and my professor was recording
:p
sooooooo
oh nooo
nightmare moment right there
it's fine though
the recording is probably gone now
im more aware of my mic yeah i kinda check that its muted religiously
sameeeeeeeeee
hopefully 🤞
i get so anxious
and then i also worry about what people see me doing
usually i just make sure my camera is in an ok position then i dont wanna look at myself anymore tho
even if i'm just stretching cause sometimes i like to make faces
ahahahah i just sit and stare at the screen and i HOPE i didnt stretch strangely without realizign it
lmaoooo that's also a good way
tho i hate people looking at me, ill never know
i'm gonna miss being able to have a plushie on my table
i don't mind because people kinda stare to start sometimes
aww just carry a small one with you to class hehe
lmaoooo i keep it on my desk
it's a husky and i want to say it's as old as i am if not a bit older
omg i wouldnt want to part with it :(
lmaooooo
it's gonna stay home
but also bringing it to school  would might not turn out too well
although i swear i can't sleep without holding something like a plushie
so i will be bringing a bigger husky plushie for sure
ahh i have my sleeping phases where i have to hug a different thing sometimes lol
good idea 😌
at least you wont be as emotionally attached to a new one
i'm more concerned about the people who sleep like a log
just in case dorm life is strange
i really dont know how anyone does that
pffft
the husky that's probably as old as i am makes a barking sound
it's one of those old kids toys
ooo does it still work
it's a desk ornament, not a plushie really
probably
idk
like i don't hug it or anything
it keeps you company through ~~boring~~ claaases
ahahahahahah
i wanna bring a squishy plushie in case i ever want to hug one because the mood is very random and not that often for me
honestly i find it so funny how i want to hug people when it's a pandemic
but when it's not then i'm like what is happening when someone randomly hugs me
lolll i used to despise hugs but then i started only hugging ppl who didntl ike it and now soemtimes i just rly wanna hug someone ya know
butfor me its random so its not like when i actually see ppl i wanna hug them -_-
honestly i don't mind being hugged but that's mainly because i had a few friends who just randomly hugged me
so i'm kind of in a state of okay you want to hug me fine
you want to squish my cheeks, fine
kind of thing
oh same now but only certain people
i think the only thing i'm usually like oh no is like being picked up physically
i couldnt name the conditions but sometimes im repulsed lmaoo
i've had people try to pick me up and it's weird as heckkkkkkkk
thats strange
i know
i only allow piggy back rides if its someone i trust
but normal picking up uhh nty
i also happen to have a number of tall friends
it's probably cause they're tall
my friends are all taller so i think theyre tall
but not thattt tall
tall friends tend to have a thing for being like, let me help you experience what it's like to be way too far off the ground
i mean i look not too short with my friends
but some of them are like 6ft?
my friends just use me as an armrest thats it >:(
oh my
i dont think any of my school friends are that tall lol
it's honestly really funny but a lot of the people i know just tower over me
omg theres this guy that i have to just LOOK UP to talk to
and i mention it every time
honestly i swear it's because i'm short
and that's why i always end up wondering how tall people are
because i need to know if they have that potential thought process of "aerin is short and small, i want to lift"
anyone taller than me significantly just
idk how to put it
theyre all te same height to me
just tall
ahahah
even if they might be 6 in apart
i keep track of people's heights mainly cause i need to know where i measure up to
that way i know who i can hide behind and for what situations
LOL i just use anyone handy if needed
im annoyed i shrank 3 times already
oh actually
random human bio fact i learned a while back
you shrink over the course of a day
ah ive heard of that
ahahahah
ok like 3 years ago i swear the dr said i was 5' 2.75" so i was like AIFHIEFSISG ILL GET TO 3
idk when i went back again i think i shrunk
supposedly i shrank a whole 0.5 inches
and a few weeks ago i had to get some shots lmao and apparently im 2.25 now :'))))
oh thats 2 shrinks not 3
buuuut when i measured at home, i was exactly 5'3
soooooo idk what they were talking about
but i swear that's also short people problems
people are like... why are you using decimal points
riiiiight
and they're like tall
honestly i consider 5'8 or taller tall
cause that's a whole five inches over my head
ok i should keep measuring til i grow again uh maybe i was standing badly that day
ahahahah
Average for dudes is like 5 9 right
idk
oh i dont even know my standard because so many people are at least a head taller
I remember looking it up and finding out I was exactly average lol
ask another dude maybe they'd know
i only know that women is either 5'4 or 5'3
lol also avg by country (usa) or just overall
honestly no clue
yeah i remember 3 or 4 but i thought guys was like 8
tbh i don't mind being short, it's just kinda like argH when people bring it up
idk i dont care once theyre taller than me ahaha
okay but either way i still think 5'8 is tall
ok true i always justify why short>> tall
it's five inches over my head
Women is 5 4
Just looked it up
i cant imagine a 5'8 person rn
i-
oh
i can sorta
i swear, tall people don't feel that tall until you stand next to them
so ethan, you're a whole half a foot taller than i am
congrats
wellll i think short has more advantages someti es but i just like complainign about it becase ppl make me think short = bad oops
I’m honored
youer more than a half a foot taler  !!
like i had a classmate in middle school who was 6'4 and i stood next to him
what
What the fuck
Middle school???
and it was interesting how short i felt
Shit bruh I would feel short too
yeah i was in 6th and he was in 7th
i think he went to lynbrook for a bit?
i cant imagine lol
ahahaha
wait ethan isnt there another ethan lin
I vaguely remember an extremely tall person at my middle school but not lynbrook
i always forget how tall people are but people at 6ft don't feel too tall to me
Funny story, there were like five Ethan lins total at lynbrook
are you sure, i thought he went there
Three of which were in my year
he would have been  a year above you
oh lmaoo well i think i know one of them
All three of us were in the same freshman pe class
my parents said that if i was a boy they would have called me ethan lmfao
One of us one of us one of us
ahahahah
Wait which one
how did they even separate you guys lol
Glasses or no glasses
ummm
long hair
?
By number
Oooh yea
He’s a good friend of mine
never talked to him tho lol
i suddenly remembered something really stupid
ooh yeah him
i had a classmate who i shared the same set of initials with so the teacher asked who had a middle name and he did so he had to put the initial for his middle name as well
and it was frederick or something
but he kept insisting to me that his middle name was pencil sharpener
this was in second grade, mind you
thats an interesting lie
did you believe it lmaoo
no
i thought it was hilarious
2nd grade is just a strange year tho
he also got held back a year
oh-
like in kindergarten or something
Oh yea similar story
I got the nickname sanic in middle school bc I chose it to differentiate myself from the other Ethan lins
My parents told my middle school that my middle name was S, so I expanded it to sanic
ahahah
did they just let you do that 😩
trueeee
that is an important question
oh sanic is gone
oop
honestly it's weird having a middle name now
i feel like most people have had one for most of their lives
i actually picked my brother's middle name apparently
Well yes
is your middle name part of the system or does it just register as a nickname?
my parents really just gave me a list and said pick
so influential lmaoo
oh i had an official amendment
For the official documentation it was just S.
i mean all the names started with 'c'
did they ever tell you your actual middle name
wow what if they were quirky and made it "S." lmao dont people use symbols in names now 👀
guess they do?
idk i've only heard one instance
i guess they could if they really wanted to
Elon musks kid
exactly what i was thinking
honestly i already have a hard time thinking up names for pets, much less children
scratch that
i can't even name variables, much less pets or children
ahahahah
LOL me thats why my stuffed animals dont even have names
if anything i'm probably going to steal names from tolkein or dvergatal
i hope i never have to name someithng
well you might have to name variables and stuff
i also end up having to name essays
and poems
and whatever else my brain comes up with
oh my gosh yeah those are hard enough
and then it turns into what in the actual world does any of this mean
i think one year when my teacher cared about essay names i woukd actaully get points off
so when people ask i smile and laugh
i just follow a format
i put random synonyms together
and then i say here you go
big brain
but for poems and stuff i just use whatever really random, abstract thing comes up in my brain first
sometimes i give up and im like "1984 essay"
ahahahah
i havent written a poem since 9th so havent thought about that!
i mean people tend to find deeper meanings in poems
so i assume they'd do the same with titles
it's one of those tricks
kinda like how people find random deeper meaning in art sometimes
oooh yes there are so many interpretations of things that werent even supposed to be things
and i just happen to remember the names of random artists and some of their works
(as you can see my word usage is great)
i learned some art history as a child
so i know a decent bit about older art
oh i know 0 abput art
it's honestly just part of the random stuff i happen to know
even tho i took classes before and we learned a bit of that
lmaooo i learned it when i was really young
it was kinda drilled into my brain
just like how to play black jack
and playing hidden object games
ahh even games ive played sooo many times, i still need a refresher if i havent played in a while
its so bad
i need to fix my memory
lmaooo
idk how tho lol my parents just say SLEEP
i don't know why i remember how to play blackjack so clearly
honestly same
i have memory loss
litearlly my mom questions why my memory is worse than hers and im at a loss for words
and sometimes when i google memory loss and i look at the specific kind  i might have
i end up asking myself if google might be accurate when it gives me dementia
googling symptoms is
sketchy
ahahah
but same 😩
i've had people tell me i asked them the same question five or six times
and every single time i say "wait really?"
same same or they say something i didnt know i told them and im like :surprised:
i also remember almost nothing about my childhood or even like more recent stuff
everything goes in my brain and leaves again
im always paranoid ill repeat a story or thing to someone i told before and theyll think i didnt care to remembe ror smth
ackkk same
i barely have memories of the house i lived in til literally end of 5th grade
my worst anxiety is that i've said something bad and people remember
and then they'll ask me what i meant
and i won't know because no memories
confrontation ESPECIALLY for things i litearll ydont recall are the worst
i just cant deal w it
ahahah worst part is that when i do briefly remember things
i always end up realizing that the people i knew growing up were crappy people when i knew them
so then i feel like whatever cause you were horrid too
awh my brief memoreis usually end up in me intensely cringing at myself
and it's so ridiculous
that too
but usually i end up remembering why i don't talk to some people and stuff
but i've been meeting less and less crappy people now
so that's gotta be a good thing :3
just forget about those people who werent good for you !! easier said than done sometimes
the fact that there are only four of us online ahahah
yayy hopefully that keeps improving
i forget them
often and then accidentally offend them
oh its 2:43?! what happened to the time
ahahah
is what i ask myself
but then it doesnt really matter anymore
i just like being wide awake at night
me too night is so much better
but i also have to wake up tomorrow to go outside and walk ;w;
i honestly need night owls in revelle because i might just not sleep and want to chat all night
o shoot i might need to wake up early as well im moving some stuff to sd
ahahahah
wait revelle is so far from me :(
i'm excited to hopefully get to stay up late more often at ucsd ahahah
righttttt you're on the other side of campus
ahkfalskhfdaf
my closest night owl friend is at muir i-
i said i wanted to fix my sleep schedule but tbh it 99% wont happen especially if i get later classes
oh i have to fix it but no morning classes for me
it's always cold in the morning, esp in winter
sucksssss
i just barely know people so im hoping after school starts ill be able to find those night owls
what college are you in?
im in erc
isn't erc past muir
ahhh yeah im in revelle and had some friends in erc
idk how i got placed there but it is what it is lolll
erc is allllll the way north, right before 7th
its a few past muir lol
revelle was my second choice i think
idk
my mom was like gl getting to classes
erc was my 5th but now i wish i put it last LOL thought it didnt matter that much near the end
but i don't care cause there's the aquarium further down
i don't even know what choice revelle was for me aha
i just want to go to the aquarium sooooooo
:p
the aquariam is soooooooooo cool
there's a shuttle that runs between it and ucsd (at least pre covid)
that sounds fun
oo i dont actually know much about the campus so itll be fun to explore
my uncle was an alum from a long time ago and he told me i could get around just fine with a shuttle
yup, plus you get a free bus pass that works for like 95% of the lines in san diego
i just wanna run down to the aquarium
that's literally it
so you can get around super easily
everything else is not that interesting ahahah
that is so niceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
oooh nice i hope the shuttles work
yeah i need to find people to stay up with either at my college
im scared ill just not even be able to make it to the cogsci building or wtv right now lmaoo
or just stay up with together online
i have no clue where cogsci is at all
oh truuee
i just remember looking it up on the map and using the walking tool to see how long itd take
i forgot what it said tho
i hope it's not in the warren area
cogsci is pretty close to geisel!
ohhhhhhhhhh that is going to be funnnnnnnn
so like middle of campus, but a little more left
(if you are looking at it top down)
i can get my exercise in ig :p
yuppp you definitely get your steps in ehre xD
oh i was gonna say i think a lot of ppl study there so if needed i might just crash there lmaoo
i wish i actually found geisel interesting enough to remember the architect's name smh
i tell myself this is a good way to improve my health
some of the housing at ucla is done by john lautner
but im also dreading it
im terrible with names so i have no clue xD
oh i dont know a single architect ever
i only remember around 10 names for architects at most
and most of them had random buildings that i just found pretty
haha that's awesome
i probably know more renaissancce artists off the top of my head though
ooo that's neat
what made you remember those?
good for trivia yay!
my mom taught me art history and used to drill me
we had this book with a card game
and i must have memorize the names before i knew it
huh that's interesting
why art hsitory?
i think that's why i got into reading mirror text too and font names
my mom likes art
idk
i just know
sadly i forgot most the random info i used to know
i know a number of fonts by name
it keeps me busy when i'm bored
i play a guessing game and try to determine whether someone's using google or microsoft based on font
i also know some of the apple fonts
that’s so interesting
it's honestly very useless information
haven’t heard of anyone who does that
but presentations are so boring sometimes
LOL true gotta spice it up
lmaoooooo
i think i could only name times new roman and some strange fancy fonts i used to like a while back
ohhhhhhh those are pretty cool
cringing at how i used to use child flowery font on presentations and stuff
i hateeee timse new roman but that might just be because i hate writing essays lolol
i usually just use some kind of sans serif or serif font
i don't like times new roman cause it's times new roman and prefer palatino
tnr just reminds me of school and mla:(
same
i honestly just keep one original copy of the formatting and fill everything else in
i set my default font on google drive to times new roman to save time and i will be so happy the day i can change it to something fun
i think i used to use comic sans unironically but we don’t speak about that anymore
i honestly find essays and english the easiest of all classes
i used to love timed essays
i did that too on my old school account but that’s deleted now agh i should’ve changed it
and i think my teacher hated me for loving timed essays
i don’t agree with you uhhh do you wanna take mmw for me LMAO
well he didn't actually hate me
i was one of his favorite students
but i would write a ton of pages of stuff
it was usually pretty thick when i was finally done
ok i used to like them bc my take home essays were basically timed because i would procrastinate soo much and they’d be the same quality
oh my that’s more work for the teacher tho
yeahh
imagine how the person grading my whap test felt
they probably felt like they got slapped with a giant tidal wave of words
maybe they saw the stack and just gave it a good grade :D
lmaoo
reminds me of how ppl would say to just ramble on act essay and you’d do well
i'm just really quick to make thing sup
oml that act essay is so easy
so was the sat essay
except that one time where i got a low score for arguing against the prompt
but we don't talk about that
i did better on the act one for both parts lol
sad moment when i remmeber that they did nothing for my admissions
LOL
i thought the essay was the easiest part of the standardized test
i was so bad with math
i really got a 27 on math
even though i did calc ab
i definitely didn’t like the essay
ripp sometimes it’s easier without the higher level knowledge tho because i think it only went to geo or alg
honestly that is so fair
ngl i did terrible in precalc/trig as in i understood almost nothing
and i still did just fine in calculus ab
i left with an a
reminds me of how i tried tot tutor a 6th grader in a class i never took bc i skipped it... they were learning smth SO USELESS i didn’t know how to do it aidkskckdkcd
then a semester later i had to drop calc bc because it was like gibberish to me
uhm an a in calc is more than just fine
you did great!
ahahahah
hmm i did rly well in precancerous but bc was much more difficult but i did well bc the ap test was online and there wasn’t mcq lmao
um autocorrect i mean prevalent
precancerous
i was lucky my professor took out the part of the final on integrals since everyone bombed that part
PRE CALC
xDDDDD
ahahah
integrals suck so that's so valid
my phone hates me
i agree i forgot how it even works
i only like derivatives
and my stats class was wayyyyyy better
derivatives are easier and you don’t have to +c it
i just got to use my calculator and not show most of my work
derivatives and limits are great, integrals are the worst
lol stats annoyed me there was too much writing
calc b is a worse jump than calc c tho (imo) so it doesn't scale up forever
i literally took ab and bc back to back in semesters and still forgot integrals
so now i have to retake bc cause i dropped it
its okay you can take fewer courses whenever you have to take calc b (if you want to)!
you probably will have to do calc c as well but it's not as bad as calc b imo
lmao i have most of my ges done so i can't put it off much longer to begin with lmaoooo
as of now i only need linear algebra but if i try to change something about my path then i might need to do 20c whatever that is and i don’t wanna have to relearn
20c is calc c
it's not too bad imo
oh that is going to be fun in the most painful way possible
doing multidimensional derivatives sounds terrible but it's not actually that bad
for cogsci it isn’t required *i think*
it's literally just do the derivative twice
and that's pretty much the whole calss
oh what
"do this thing you alreayd know how to do, but do it twice instead"
that is actually kinda nice
yah its definitely not as hard of a jump as b is lolol
b is not a jump
it's a shove
off a cliff
it doesn’t sound too bad now but idk you might just be very smart lolll
i don’t even know if calc bc also teaches a? never understood the system
there is some other stuff that's new too ofc but it's definitely not the worst thing in the world
it's fine though, i think my current existing college gpa can carry me even if i mess up two math classes
ya plus you might be able to take some stuff p/np as well (can't remember if math is able to be) so that's always an option
whenever i see p/np i think of that millenium problem
which problem?
it's one of those very difficult to solve math problems that has like a huge reward if you can get the correct solution
OH THAT P/NP
i want to say that one of them did get solved but i also might have remembered wrong
yeah it's a huge problem in math/cs, it might get covered in spis a bit but im not sure
i’ve never heard of it i just searched it up lmao
i know they mentioned p/np but not the actual problem itself
i was watching gifted and the millenium problems came up
along with the trachtenberg method i think
i remember uselessly large words and then when i need to use them my brain goes b l a n k
sounds like another last name
trachtenberg is a last name
my brain forgets sooo many words it makes me so annoyed during timed essays because i can’t think about what that random common word is
i am usually that one student who is technically done but keeps writing anyway
yeah all these equations  and methods named after people just confuse me
could never relate
hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia is permanently etched into my brain
i usually have half my paper written and it’s just unfinished
that word sounds strangely familiar
i know i have a large vocabulary
i just never use it
it's the fear of long words xD
and i really like learning those random words from tumblr that are so rarely used
and then i don't use them
i love that
i think i used to do that
the only time those tumblr words ever come into use is when yet another person titles a fanfic using one of those
like defenestrate
i’m surprised i actually remembered one of the strange words i learned
i learned words like gracile
which i never use
and then i randomly apply chemistry terminology to real life
despite sleeping through my chemistry honors class during my second semester
doesn’t even sound english tbh
i still don't know how i got an a in that class
lolll i like randomly throwing in chem bc that class actually interested me
and my chem 1a was carried by huge extra credit
i overuse state function
not in the literal sense
but i just use it to mean like the process isn't important, just the destination
i think i've also equated people to the different elemental groups before
oh lmaoo i was thinking boit it
wow
and people always look at me funny for it
i would probably tbh LOL
not that i find it important how they feel lmfao
you just seem like a metalloid today
i'll just be like "noble gas personality type" out of the blue
or i'll say someone's like a halogen
oh wait groups not properties see i forogt most my chem oops
wait i could see the noble gas tho
i think the weirdest thing i've ever done was try to convert all my writing into old english runes
maybe even alkaline earth it’s strange
oh i really can’t deal w old english
old english and old english runes are different
the runes looked a lot like dwarvish from lotr
and i thought they were pretty
OH
yeah
i just searched it ok
i mean before that i wanted to write mirror script but being left handed, i technically could have done that to start
gives me hieroglyph vibes
yeah it really does
there's also elvish which is pretty
i also at one point wanted to be ambidextrous
have you practiced mirror script at all?
so i can kinda write with my right hand
oo elvish looks mystical
i mean i usually don't but i can do it alright
ahahah i used to practice my left
i can read mirrored text just fine
i can technically draw with my right hand using a mouse
but not with a pencil
there were a few stages where i literally would use my left in school but then i started to need to write fast and that didn’t work
not that well
ahahah when i write fast i end up with print-cursive
i’ve never tried because i just can’t draw at all with anything LOL
the only thing i can consistently draw are cats
and sometimes bears
my handwriting is pretty bad it looks scribbly because i end up connecting everythibg
i need to learn how to draw cute animals
i learned cursive and now i mix my print and cursive
like just stick figure version
it looks confusing as heck though reading my notes
usually when i write words that end in ing, the i disappears
it just leaves
i guess some of my writing is cursive because of how it connects but i usually don’t write things like the cursive s anymore
i also don't dot my i's anymore sooooooooo
my i's and e's look similar
i haven’t written in so long i can’t remmeber how i write
many times when i write my names i don’t write 2 n’s properly
ahahahah i write things down by hand
i just have some lumpy scribbled
i tend to forget otherwise
cause if i type i sometimes i forget to check where i left whatever i wrote down
ah i like typing bc i’ll forget anyways LOL
honestly i just realized
i'm kinda like a function
oh i guess sometimes it doesn’t motivate me to read notes as much but
hmm
i just take in input, create an output
and then i forget everything again
LOL
it actually explains why i have no clue what i've turned in for the most part
especially my essays, thank goodness no one asks me to explain those
Won’t comment on that bc i don’t wanna say some strange incorrect code thing in a cs server 😩
ahahah i made my brother so frustrated
he was trying to help me check my code
o m g do you just turn in assignments or tests and completely forget the topic or prompt
and then he was like wth
oh i don't even really remember the prompt after i write it
i tried to ask my sis but i forgot she knows nothing 😭
ahahah
ikr people ask what i wrote about and i’m like ... what did we even do
i literally just try to think of the easiest way to solve the problem so i can write almost zero code
i mean i just make something up
if i get a hint of what i should say, i can usually make something up
guess the theatre classes i took panned out years ago
i wanna write less but my brain doenst process til after i do smth rly convoluted lmao
ahhhhhh same
i usually say something and then i end up overexplaining myself
oo theater fun fun those classes scare me tho
they give me so much anxiety
but i also did them ig
that’s me 50% of the time
if i do speak i’ll overspeak
technically i guess i can act, i'm good with expressions
but a lot of times i just don’t speak at all lol
ahahah
when we had to do closing circle i really wrote out what i was going to say
i still panicked anyway ahahah
oo i just know i did one acting thing as a child and i laugh sm when i watch now and wonder what the heck happened to me
i used to do musicals so theoretically i should be okay with like idk stages?
but i'm not
oh i didn’t get to go today :( how was it? forogt to ask someone about it
it took a long time
and everyone just kinda thanked other people
i used to have the worst stage fright (probably still do)
and i just read whatever i wrote while panicking
oh i have stage fright too
aw that’s nice i would probably not wanna speak up tho lmao
the deer in the headlights
oh it was mandatory for everyone
oh
well
guess i’ll experience it next week
ajejdkskckdkck
i swear things were easier when we were kids
like being on stage and stuff
i don't know how i did it then
everything was easier then
it really wassss
i really wanna channel my younger energy
but i cannot comprehend
honestly i was thinking back to the musicals i did
and i just realized how weirdly sexist my fair lady was
like there's this whole song when the english professor rants about women
i don’t rly know musicals well but i guess many were made back in the day where it was normal to be misogynistic
trueeeee
honestly i got into musicals because of my parents
i think a few years ago i wanted to try to do a musical but obviously my stage fright completely killed that
awwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
i think the first musical i saw was les mis or phantom
i didn't understand the lovely ladies thing until like years later
oo do your parents watch a lot
no not really
my first (and only i think) was phantom
my dad just had them and i was introduced to them early
although i watched ghibli films long before that
ah makes sense
oh those are all cute throwbacks now
i think the last muscial i saw was carrie
oh wait i saw hamilton last year but it was from home so idk if that counts lol
ohhh hamilton is fun
i don't remember if i did
but i was looking forward to the in the heights film
i just know it was free on disney + for a bit and my sister had my friends account lmao
oh that one sounds familiar i think my school did it and my friend was a part of it
did you ever have a gymnastics phase?
now that i think of it, maybe my first musical was sound of music
omg i did gymnastics in prek i think lmao
ahahah sameeeeeeeeeee
and then i stopped
but i really wanted to do a handstand, so i taught myself
started dance around that time tho and that was what i stuck with but i did have a few phases throughout where i wanted to do gymnastics things
i swear everyone did back in those days
ahahah
oh sound of music has nice songs at least the ones i know lol
i still can’t handstand
i’m WEAK
i did ballet i think idk
i don''t remember
i can still do it, but it's best when you're in a pool
soo much easier
i did ballet til 7th i think then technically did it in hs but not rly
oh i’ve never tried in a pool
i don’t like water tbh i can’t even breathe easily when i’m standing in a pool lolll
ohhh
that actually makes sense
you could also do it against a wall
i can see how handstand would be easier but like id prob choke on water LOL
oh yes i used to do that but my arms would give out too soon hehe
i honestly went through trial and error to do it
but i also did basketball as a sport
soooooooooo
i guess i didn’t care much about handstands bc i wanted to be flexible and do tricks more lmao
oh sports not my thing but tbh basketball was an ok unit in pe loll
i can't say if sports were really my thing
tho i’ve barely scored any baskets in my life
i just did them
same
i was only good at guarding
dance was my only athletic thing ever til that one year of track ew
yeah i can’t do that either but ehhh whatwver LOL
i just didn't like doing offensive stuff
not gonna play bball in the future or anything
honestly if i actually focused on cross country, my stamina would probably be better smh
i think by the end of the season was when my stamina was just beginning to get good
and then the season ended ahahahah
but that’s the hard part :’) idk how people have the motivation i wish i could
ahhhh yeah
i don't even know how i convinced myself to run 2 miles
once an xc friend tricked me into running 3 MILES i thought i was gonna die
and the worst part was i had a friend who was shouting at me to run faster ahahah
1 is my max bc it’s required in pe smh
honestly 1 mile is so nice
oh no that pressure when you’re alrd dying trying to pace yourself
pfft i would actually slow down
just to spite him ahahah
i disagree 1 lap is more than enough LOL i did sprints in t&f bc i wanted to hurdle
good solution 😌
oml the 400 m as a track event is so hardddddddddd
AGREED
i still remember doing training
i literally never did it before but my first meet, they signed everyone up for the 400
i'd have to do those weird things where you sprint 50 m and walk 50 m or something and go up by increments of 50 or something
i basically died
i ran a 3200 once
ohh yeah i think we did that
it was horrid
ewww
disgusting n
i did pretty good in 400
and then i quit
after the first meet i never did the 409 again even tho i was supposed to lmao
i did horrendous in literally everything but jumps and hurdles
honestly lining up gives me anxiety
i just get all freaked out being in line and stuff
WHCIH WERE THE REASON I WANTD TO JOIN but didn’t think i’d need to just run for 95% of practice
YES
and the gun scared me lol i have slow reflexes too
oh yeah, track definitely is like RUN RUN RUN
i joined with friends who also just wanted to do jumping events but they quit i forgot why
i used to just watch people get smoked
and i was left there not realizing jumping is for sprinters who only run during practice and have to stay extra to do other stuff lmao
like one of the soccer players was in track and he would outsprint practically everyone in the 100m
ok but it’s sometimes interesting to wat h fast ppl
i find it hilarious
also perhaps we should sleep
like i could never dream of moving at that speed it looks so strange
ahahah
oh
uhhh
like it's almost 4 am
it’s been an hr since i pointed out the time????
yes
time flies
ok yeah let’s sleep
because it's fun
i wonder if anyone is gonna even try to scroll and read tmrw LOL
but i also need to zip it and sleep before i wake up tomorrow and bask in my regret like i did this morning
i say that like it isn't already the next day
they’ll learn a lot about us without us knowing!!
it's fine
oh yes i regret my choices a little bit every morning but not enough to change my habits
because i'll probably start another long convo tomorrow :3
yay funn
ahahahahahah
y e s and we can hang out more
i don’t think i’ll get back til late so hopefully the chat goes crazy lmao
mhm mhm :)
i also have stuff to do tomorrow like looking at my classes i need for graduating in a few years lmao
oh i tried to do that before but i won’t think about that rn lmaoo GOOD NOGHT!
good nightttttttttttttt :3
good morning :)
i-
hi sammmmmm
gm streaks yall i got the grind in two hours😮‍💨
^get that money girlboss
yes i am girlbossing today
hi alexxxxxxxxx
hi aerinnnnn
last night we had a pet picture thing for a bit lmao
omg bet
i love that
yeah & someone suggested an actual channel for pet pictures :3
but it was like 1-2 am ahahahah
say less LMAO
ik my petless self is gonna get blessed with yalls pets
Y’all was up late omg
There is now a new #pet-pictures channel!
yayyyyy
@jennosaur♡ we have one nowwwww
YAY!!!
lets goooo
how’s everyone doing so far today? :3
pretty good! i woke up at 8 again today bc the spis grindset never stops
but then i went back to sleep
it was very nice
i had chipotle
hbu @ragdoll kitten?
ooh chipotle
yesss
someone remind me to get barbacoa instead of carnitas next time
my friend jokingly called it chi-pottle and i can’t read it any other way
LMAO
chee pawdle
i can't unread it
i was going to just not wake up early but my mom was like we *have* to go outside and walk sooo i got dragged outside
i literally read it that way before seeing your message too 😭
that’s hilarious
you know what i find really weird about spotify, and yes it’s really random
i set my language as english but it will still give me ads in spanish sometimes even though i don’t really understand spanish at all
sure i took three years of spanish, but i also didn’t really understand it lmao
have you googled spanish stuff lmaoo
cant relate i have premium 😌
though i do wonder what type of ads i would get
i don’t do anything in spanish at all lmao
the last time i googled spanish was for google translate
my spanish 3 teacher really thought i knew how to write essays but none of us learned how to in spanish 2
maybe they think you wanna learn spanish that way but like i don’t even know how ad algorithm works
ah sounds like chinese the first time we had to write essays too
lmaooo idk how the ad algorithms work either
youtube likes to give me men’s deodorant ads lmfao
i swear every foreign language teacher assumes you can write essays at a certain point
i used to either get the strangest or the most accurate ads it was kinda strange but now i use adblock lol
YEAH i think they just think that since you know how to write in english, you can just put that to your other lang skills
also i’m on the car and getting kinda carsick so ttyl lmao
okayyy lmao
don’t get carsick ;w;
yall im on lunch and THERE’S SO MANY CUSTOMERS
i forgot abt back to school shopping🥲🥲🥲
why lunch at 4 but good luck i swear there are so many people EVERYWHERE today
i didn’t even think about that yet 😭
and i’m not carsick anymore i got my boba fix !!!
awwwww good luck alexxxxx
also that’s good jenny!!!! :3
wait jenny what flavor??? 👀
i got jasmine mt and my sister got regular so basically both hehe
lmaoooo that’s great!!!
oh yeah i just visited ucsd for a bit and i’m estimating that it’ll take me around 20 min to get to geisel/cogsci building every day 😭 i’m actually so tired from just walking around a bit LMAO
aaaaaaaaa that sounds p long for a walk
especially if you haven’t been walking much
ngl i don’t go outside most days of the week myself ahaha
this school will def improve my stamina lmaoo and my daily steps
fr fr!!! i swear i get more exercise when school is in-person
otherwise i’m like, i’ll just stay indoors
definitely lol my parents usually can’t even get me to open the door to get some light
lmaooo
i feel like it’s such a hassle going outside
it really is... i know it’s good for me and all that but
my parents are like wear a mask, wipe your hands every time you get back to the car, wash them when you get home, wipe everything you buy
i felt that sooooo hard
i swear my doctor is secretly thinking that this is exactly why i have a vitamin d deficiency
ohhh yeah i think for the first year my mom religiously wiped everything but i think now we’re just like whatever it should be alright
oh 😭 i started taking d3 pills ever since i went to the doc a few weeks ago LOL
i was supposed to start taking them way back in 6th grade after i went to my doctor about wrist pain
i had to get examined pretty thoroughly cause she was convinced i either had arthritis or carpal tunnel
but then they did bloodwork ig and i had a vitamin d deficiency
ofc i constantly forget to take the pills lmfao
oh my it was that bad :// lol i keep forgetting as well
tbh i should take all the vitamins uhh i think i’m deficient in everything healthy
well she prescribed painkillers that didn’t work soooooo i guess that was why she thought that?
m e
i have like two i have to take daily
and one of them is like an inch long
why did the painkillers already not work oh no i thought those were supposed to gradually stop working
sounds so funnn i’ve never been prescribed anything long term before
i have no idea honestly
i guess it was cause it wasn’t something painkillers could help with??? idk but it got better because of the vitamin d supplements lmao
i’m gonna have to take two giant bottles of supplements with me and my melatonin ahaha
oh i kinda forgot what d even helps with... was it bone strength? i guess thatd make sense
ah melatonin
i keep stopping myself from taking it even though multiple people have told me to lol
my parents bought it for me after a psychiatrist said to i think, or something
it’s nice when i messed up my sleep schedule and need to brute force fix it
oh yeah that’s true it can stop your sleep from getting worse and worse and worse
which is exactly what i need to do today
i guess i’m saving it for when i really need it so that it’ll actually work on me lolll
i went out, came home and napped soooo i just woke up a few minutes agoo
yeah don’t overtake
oh love that i took a short nap in the car earlier
i knew someone who took a bunch of high dosage melatonin and at some point it just stopped working
so def be careful about taking too much cause the stronger sleep meds are illegal here i think or at the very least, extremely difficult to obtain
at least from what i’ve heard
oh i wouldn’t be surprised yeah
i also don’t wanna be reliant on it so i assume it’ll be a once in a while thing (but idk i have no idea how it’s like so i don’t wanna get addicted LOL)
oh it’s weird as heck when it kicks in
it kinda feels like when you’re sick and you took medicine and you’re slowly getting increasingly tired
and then you’re guaranteed around 5 hours i think
oh wow
but it’s not like it instantly kicks in
all i remember is that once i was sick and i took nyquil to help slepe and instead i woke up like 1-2 hrs later and got even more sick smh
ahhhhh being sick sucksssss
ah it’s like a delayed thing
another reason why i don’t go outside
yeah i literally woke up and RAN to the bathroom it was not fun
yeah omg i also kinda skipped allergy season because i didn’t go outside
i didn’t have those 3 months of sneezing
i really skipped getting sick all of my senior year and i was soooo happy
especially when i got to skip flu season i was overjoyed :3
ooo nice i got sick last month for a bit but it wasn’t bad at all so i’m glad :)
also eek gtg to a fancy work dinner thing i hate these i feel so out of place
good luckkkkkkkkk
i’m extremely bored this event is literally called a financial group HOMECOMING i’m cringing
and the food is fancy but im a simple gal so i’ll just sit here being antisocial on my phone lmaoo
yayyyyyyy jennyyyyy
i can keep you company while i do my aps ahahah
lol i literally just picked up my phone
oh gosh i gotta do that when i get back
i started but i procrastinated
i'm telling myself i have to get it done
i spent all of high school procrastinating
and i have some pretty interesting stories from that
so needless to say, i'm trying to get it together and not do that through all of college ahahah
see i tell myself i’m gonna improve in college but who knows what’ll actually happen
i don’t even count doing a small-ish assignment the day before procrastinating tho LOL especially since i’ve kinda looked at it and thought about it
i procrastinated on a whap shower curtain and ended up ruining a decent jacket over it
so i'm trying not to have a repeat of that in college
i just realized i also semi-slept through the star wars unit of my whap class and some of my english classes before
shower curtain???
and star wars? that seems so strange in whap lmaoo i didn’t take that class but my friends only had boring old history stuff
did no one else take whap and have to do a giant shower curtain?
as for star wars, my teacher had us watch it to learn how to write the long essays questions and the saqs
apparently it had all the proper components for a response that would get you a good score
but i really just kinda slept through part of the star wars thing
although my teacher was a *huge* star wars fan, as in he had boba fett tattooed on his arm
so maybe he just chose star wars cause he liked it a bunch ahahah
oh that’s interesting i guess it’s a good way to get some ppl engaged lol
uh maybe but i’ve never heard a word about it and it sounds so out of place 😩
honestly though i can understand star wars being unique
but i swear it wasn't just me who had to do the giant shower curtain thing
i had to go out and buy a giant shower curtain in like april or may to use it for the project
i don’t rly like star wars oops i fell asleep when i tried to watch once
lmaoo maybe it’s a more common thing but it just sounds so strange
and then i kinda procrastinated until like 11 pm and stayed up until 5 am doing the project and at some point i absentmindedly messed up and one of my sleeves turned pitch black and my arm got stained too
all because i rested my arm on an uncapped black sharpie
ofc i finished the giant shower curtain and managed to turn it in just fine and got a decent grade on it
but i ruined a decent jacket over it
oh no omg sharpies are impossible
yeah and the jacket was my basketball one :p
ah yes the skill of finishing things before the deadline no matter what
aww
thank goodness my season was over or i'd have to explain the giant black stain of sharpie that wouldn't come out
y e s
i used to hear my english teachers in high school tell people not to procrastinate on the essays
and then there was me who also put it off and took like 4-5 hours to write one essay and turn it in
i don't know if they actually knew i was doing the essay last minute or not though
jennyyyyyyyyyy, how's the event?
LOL that would be so awkward
ok every teacher ever tho
they all remind us not to but we still do hehe
riiiiiight?
i feel like some teachers know not even bc of the quality but by how you act or if you talk to ppl about it
also i convinced my mom to let me leave :)))) she had no objection tho she didnt wanna be there either
that's niceeeee :3
also lowkey, i think my teachers know cause i turn things in at such odd hours
it'll be four am and my essay will just be submitted
oh true my chem teacher never let me off after i think i emailed him a question at 2-3 am
oopsies
i have a trick for that
i just preset my send
i'll have emails sending at 8 am when i'm fast asleep ahahah
oh YES i would start doing that now but i think it wasnt a thing back then or i didnt rly care
i used to submit a lot of stuff at 6-7 so they might just think i woke up early 😌
ahahahah
i usually have things in at weird times since i actually feel motivated for whatever reason at weird hours
i think that by the end of high school, my teachers just kinda stopped asking questions about why in the world i was up at like 2 am
oh for sure i dont work efficiently until i have time pressure
sometimes i try to start early but i know it takes me a lot longer if i dont have the deadline in front of my face lmao
that's why i liked timed essays so muchhhhhhhhhh
yeah i think they all got used to it
i seriously can't think of anything to write when i'm trying to write an essay early usually
i would say same but i also just hate essays LOL i'd much rather have timed tho so they have lower expectations
IKR
i have an unimaginable amount of run on sentences
it's not even a joke
i try really hard not to, but it happens so muchhhhh
but tbh sometimes idk what to write during a timed one either... like once in lang i think i sat there for 15 min with a blank paper then decided to bs it
OH SAME
well it happens more when im rambling
like my long blocks of msgs that have 0 punctuation
oml i try not to let my sentences get too long
i think in essays i at least use ,cc or make it somehow grammatically correct but just long and wordy
*try is the key word for me but i usually fail lolll
but i got into a bad habit of writing exceedingly long sentences with no real idea of when i should stop the sentence
yeah! and its also strange to separate into short sentences sometimes
i used to get in so much trouble for having like 10 different run ons
it just sounds so robotic to me idk how to explain it
i definitely had comments about that lol
i don't get how anyone writes essays without run ons
yeah sometimes the ideas come while youre writing and it all relates so i wanna keep it in one sentence! but some ppl just know what theyre saying beforehand so it sounds good lol
that is so true
but also when i usually write, it's not for schoolwork so i created a bunch of really really really bad habits
oo do you do creative writing
yessssssss
what about youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
woooo im definitely not creative enough to write so nopee
lmao do you have any other hobbies? :3
but one of my freidns does and she wrote a lord of the flies fanfic with our freidns in it and i think its about 200 google doc pages AHAFHJSFHSJDB
im kinda boring i dont do anything anymore
oml i could neverrrrrrrrrrr
i used to dance and sing hehe but since quarantine i havent rly done either
ohhhhhhh that's so cool
there's this stage apparently near 6th that does karaoke?
i would sit around bored thinking of things to do but not actually doing it... then 2021 started and i finally started watching shows to pass time but thats not rly productive
or maybe i just don't remember which college correctly ahahah
:o
but
i also am too scared of people to sing in front of others LOL
i think i've only ever written 150 ish pages
thats still crazy
but i have hit 200 pages compiling recipes i found interesting
i think cookbooks are one of the faster ways to have an insane amount of pages
oh wow i keep on wanting to learn to cook but i dont really know what the heck we have at home so i also just give up oops
thats very true
ingredient lists can take up a lot of space lmao
honestly, i don't know how to cook, i just follow the instructions
it works out just fine
wait jennyyyyyyyyyyy
what shows have you been watchinggg
tbh i havent ever tried by myself bc ii dont actually wanna eat whatver i want to make lolll
hmmm i started with kdramas then moved to cdramas
no american shows unforunatley
or anime
ahahah cdramas
i admire your patience
LOL
not me watching in 2x speed for everything ever tho
my parents used to have me watch those taiwanese tv shows and ahklajdfks
:o i never watched but theyd run in the background lmao
i would just be like "HURRY UP AND GET TOGETHER, IT'S SO OBVIOUS YOU TWO WILL DATE"
AHAHAHA most romcoms are all the same and cliche now
fr fr
i havent rly been watching much these past 2 months tho
which is good ig because i cant binge during school lol
or can i
n o
eh i should probably be more socially involved instead of watching something i dont even feel like watching sometimes 😩 litearlly some shows were for the sake of wasting a day away
i felt that
honestly i'm kinda surprised no one has joined us yetttttttttt
i guess no one checks this server randomly lolll
oh yeah do you think youre gonna join any clubs?
honestly i have no idea
felt that so hard
i mean there are so manyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
ikr ! seems overwhelming tbh
it's like high school clubs x 100 i swear
but my sister was like "youd BETTER go to the club tables and go to events and stuff etc etc"
ikr i tried to go to some but i went once and dipped oops-
let's be real, i didn't join any clubs in high school
i didn't join any clubs at the community college i was at either
i don't think clubs were as important as people thought they were
i "joined" a few but i cant actually name a single one that i went to and knew what was happening in
mhm unless you were an owner or had a position AND it was actually somewhat influential
my honors bio teacher had an anime club that i occasionally crashed
i remember she liked one piece
oh i have a horror story about a club leader
it's not like horror horror
but man it sucked
:oo oh no what happeend
so this kid was a freshman in my chem honors class cause he apparently took a bio class at harker summer before school started and he made a science club which he claimed would be amazing
ofc i ended up joining cause i was interested and he said he wanted to be a cardiothoracic surgeon and i thought perhaps there would be dissections and fun things
instead, i found out we were studying
yes, *studying*
and it wasn't like the normal stuff we learn in high school, we were studying for the national science bowl for whatever reason
LOL WHAT
not the horror i was expecting but still horror nevertheless 🥴
and the most "fun" thing he did was a project where people made ovens out of old pizza boxes and tinfoil which is something you can do as a child
the national science bowl stuff is the horror
it lives in my nightmares
everything there was so abstract and weird
strange science project lol
wow you actually kept going to the club after finding out what it was about??
nope
i ditched shortly afterwards despite him trying to get me stay for a bit
ig it had something to do with me being decent at chem + bio but like no way was i going to study some weird abstract stuff when our team was weaksauce
they spent a few months and then went to competition and then lost within the first round
oof rip him but yeah i wouldnt stay if it ended up being so different
welppp not really a surprise ig
apparently the club is still around
oh ! did they improve at all
that i don't know
i highly doubt they went too far in the competition though
there were a lot of other school within our bracket that could easily beat them out
the only two extracurriculars at my school that were clubs and actually good at what they did would be mock trial and robotics
in my sophomore year the school's mock trial went to state, i think
and robotics went to worlds in texas
the only two extracurriculars at my school that were clubs and actually good at what they did would be mock trial and robotics
o hey thats pretty impressive
i think the only other club i can remember being relatively remarkable was the math & physics tutoring club
but yeah, most of the clubs at my school were random though i think we had an esports club
and we had a nintendo club for one year
oh wow people have the weirdest things
omg
i think one year some dudes made a kendama club
do you even remember those things :')))
oml thoseeee
weren't they popular in elementary school?
that was sooooo long ago i swear
for us i think it was a 7th grade phase
omg elem school was rainbow look and those weird circle coin game things you flipped
forgot the name tho
oml rainbow loom?
that's been so longggggggggg
oh yes i make typos all the time if you havent noticed heheh
the only really interesting that happened during my elementary school days was i had a bunch of overnight trips starting in 3rd grade
so i can safely say i've been to a farm and smelled what farm smells like
farms dont smell too good yuck
i dont remember my field trips
we used to go hiking a lot tho and i think rancho san antonio has a farm if you know what that is
i just remember my overnight trips cause i had two each year including my 6th grade
sad moment when my child self was better at walking than me now
ooo nice i think i had overnight for science camp
i actually kinda know where that is
and i also had school retreats so those were overnight
i used to have beach trips for three years straight
we'd camp somewhere and then go to the beach during the day
it was during the fall, around october-november i think when we'd go
so it was cold as heckkkkk
i do not like camping bc of the bugs lmao i get bitten so much
oh yeah beach is fun on warm days
omg i hate camping for that same reason
i remember my 4th grade trip was gold country so we went to somewhere in norcal
no wait
that was my 5th grade 2nd overnight
my fourth grade's non-beach trip was the one where we went to mendocino
and the car ride suckedddddddddddd
i think everyone got slightly carsick
and we lived in cabins in the woods and there were bugs
ahhh yeah i used to get super carsick so it was bad
yuck
and i saw a banana slug and screamed
ahahah
omg people used to lick those things
and kiss them
and i'd just stare at them grossed out
if i expect to see one, they dont rly creep me out too much but theyre still so strange
its so nasty
and there were also creeks and people would really play in them even though there were water skeeters on the water
YUCK
my hatred for banana slugs is exactly why i couldn't attend ucsc ahahah
although it wasn't as bad as the invitation i got last year from  a school whose mascot was a spider
and they really said they thought they could see me as a spider i-
LMAO ive been there a lot because i had a camp tehere every year
ummmmm
nty i wouldnt even apply if i knew that was a school mascot lmao
love that we're :ucsd_triton:
yesssssssssssssssssssssssss
baically a fork
yesssssssss
not scary 😌
i just realized my two high school friends who are at ucs are bears
like both of them
i only know berkeley is bear but idek the other mascots lol
slug bruin thats all i know
ucla is also a bear
oh wait a bruin is a bear
i didnt even realize lmaoo
and then ucsb is a black big cat who wears a funny hat i think
and then there's another uc with a dude who has a big cheesy grin
at least i think there is idk
the mascots are all slightly strange except for berk i think
uci is anteater
oh right i got a lot of emails about becoming an anteater lmao
lmaooooo
i don't know how people keep friendships when they're at different schools ngl
but i did tell my friend at ucla we should meet up sometime
and my friend who's going to u of toronto promised to drop by and visit me in sd :3
ahhhh yeah omg even for my friends who left to go to a diff high school, we kinda lost touch after a while
and we still all live in the same area...
ooo nice i know someone at la who said we should meet up in the middle sometime :))
ahahahah my friend who's going to u of t moved away to seattle and there's a cat cafe there
and ig they haven't visited it yet cause i didn't get pictures yet ahahah
but ack toronto is so far!! i know someone going to somewhere in canada but i havent talked to her recently ://
omg i love cat cafes i wanna go
honestly toronto is super farrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
same
literally the opposite side of the country but further up :(
honestly  i don't know my geography too well
so i just found that out now ahahahh
but it's all good
my geo sucks too
cause i promised i'd visit them sometime cause i wanna try poutine
but i have a friend in quebec and i know toronto is next to there lmao
that's super coollllllllllll
thats a fun reason to go visit LOL
mhm well shes an online friend but still hehe i doubt we'll ever meet
i have a bunch
and i usually stop talking to them after a while which is sad
buuuut i don't think that's gonna happen with my guild because i really don't stop talking
yeahhh that happens for me with so many people and i dont even know why it always ends up being that way
time zones really mess things up though
cause some of my friends are in se asia or something
oo nice :)) it always sucks to drift away
fr f r
oh yeah thats yet another reason i stay up late... bc some of them are only online then
i basically live in taiwan timezone a lot of the time during summer LOL thats the excuse i use when my parents find me awake when they wake up
my mom always tells me my time is upside down in chinese
and like honestly, yeah
i do tend to have my times flipped
i have a friend in taiwan but i also don't talk to her much ahahah
ahahah just gettin ready to go on vacay to asia :))
oml yesssssssssssss
i wanna go to japan
everything looks so pretty there
especially the food
ah yeah i dont think i actively talk to anyone who lives there
YES SAME
honestly now i have an actual reason to be up at odd hours since some of my friends from my guild like haikyuu and they're in a diff timezone
but it would be so hard to figure out stuff especially if i got lost or something lol
fr fr
which is exactly why i should learn some japanese
timezones are always so annyoing but also a good excuse :)
y e s
have you picked up any japanese from animes?
i picked up more japanese from the japanese medical tv show i watch than i do from animes, oddly enough
whenever i watch animes i usually just end up remembering what the subs say, not the actual japanese lmfao
oh i think reality/variety shows are usually better for learning because people speak more casually
definitely
especially since haikyuu has some dialects
thats me w kdramas lolll sometimes i basically end up reading it as a novel with a blur of movement in the back
oh rly?
like the miya twins speak in i think the kansai dialect
so they kinda speak a bit different
i picked up a bit of korean from binging an idol competition or something
TIL that japanese has dialects ahaahah im not surprised but i never realized
oh what show? i think i only know produce c ampfor k-tv shows
although i knew how to say good morning cause i had a teacher in elementary school who liked to have people do good mornings in different languages so everyone learned something new ig
i watched the unit, not produce 101 lmao
i don't know how i got into it, but i ended up hooked
oh thats fun!
never heard of that show lol but its always amazing to find something so random that you end up loving
yesssssssssssss
like i was this close to having that never be a part of my life but nopee
lmaooooooo
i feel like sometimes you don't mean to enjoy something as much as you do
but then when you find out it's just hard to stop
yesshhs and yay more ruined sleep LOL
i remember i had this phase where i thought premed and neurosurgery was so cool
and then i read when breath becomes air
and it was so sad but i liked it so much? so i bought a copy
wait jennyyyyyyy
have you ever read or seen where'd you go bernadette?
oh nopee :( never heard of it is it good?
honestly i really enjoyed it
i havent read in too long so i used to only read those classic fiction ya books or smth
i'm probably going to rewatch it when i'm at ucsd lmao
same with stick it
wait jenny what have you read?
like what's classic fiction for you?
i just searched it and i saw agoraphobic and that word just = corpse in my brain 😩 LOL
ahhhhhhh sameeee
i'm already blocking out when his birthday stream is tomorrow ahahah
my priorities are so whacked out
my memory is actually too bad o gosh i just know it was those series that people would talk about in middle school lol
omg i havent seen streams in too long i didnt realize that was happening
but rip ill be driving back to the bay
i'm honestly excited because i was at his first twitch which happened last month
and it was really fun honestly
although i do hope he finishes resi 8
i only found out that he started on twitch literally last week but im really out of the loop now and streams take so long to watch so 😭
yeah they really do
ah yes the horror game lol
some of them are soooo long
it was like 4-5 hours of streaming  i think
i used to binge watch streams on 2x after the vods were posted
it was bad
basically hapepend all of december which was LITERALLY COLLEGE APP SEASON
oml college app season ahahahahahahahah
mine was such a disaster
i really didnt start common app til 2021
i honestly just read manga instead of writing my supps
ignore that my first commonapp deadline was on either the 1st or 2nd
ah that was me with streams lol
omllllllllll that's wild
i don't even know how i survived last year
im such a bad influence lol some 22 kilds asked me about apps and i was like DONT DO WHAT I DID
me too tbh
i didnt think enough about college to care too much about apps and thats why on the day the uc was due, i was frantically looking for any major to put in lol
ahahah my mom is the one who handles the questions
but i also wasn't close with any of my underclassmen so no one asks me about stuff like that
the only app essays i'll be looking at are my other childhood friend's essays, maybe and that's cause he's the son of my mom's bestie from high school
at least for this season
ah yeah im not rly close with any but a few in my classes asked
i highly doubt ill read over anyones apps
i had no clue what i was doing myself
i read so many  fanfics that i know what bad storytelling sounds like
oh i used to read fanfics i had a phase but many just had horrendous grammar
i spent my last year of high school reading manga and fanfics
the only thing i can ado is grammar lol not the actual content
i think it depends on the fandom really, the quality is all over the place
true true
content is the only thing i can actually help with
also some are written by literal kids who dont know what theyre doign and its kinda cringe lmao
yessssssssssss
i will say that tags really cull the herd, that and how they summarize
content is more important tho like you could alwasy get grammarly to check grammar but not content lol
usually you can tell how experienced an author is from the way they summarize, tag and other stuff
oh yeah
the ones who write on tumblr as well as ao3 tend to have better content from what i've noticed
i've also noticed a bunch of wattpad writers tend to like those weird looking fonts
lol kinda hypocritical but if they dont bother to capitalize or punctuate i automatically think itll be bad
oh i litearlly havent been on tumblr i dont get how it works
honestly i have seen some decent all lowercase fics
i don't usually go on tumblr either ahahah
i didnt even know wattpad had fonts but i havent been on in years
i think it got really annoying to use
i mean they don't
somehow they have these html copy paste ones
true i think ive read some but it really depends on how they summarize or how the first part is
yessssssssssssssss
oh hmm id ont think ive noticed that?? kinda forgot tbh
shoot forgot i was gonna work on aps LOL i think im gonna go do that rn :')
oml sameeeeeeee
i gotta wrap that up
i know i left the parts i thought were harder
so hopefully it isnt too bad but
i mean
it's not graded lmaooooooo
i'm just going to answer with whatever comes out of my brain
ok true im very glad it isnt because tbh my descriptions sound very wonky and nonacademic LOL
ngl i'm approaching it the same way i approach essays
i just write without too much thought and usually things make lots of sense
now i'm kinda curious, are you the type of person who plans out an essay or one who just writes one without any planning or outlining?
actually if anyone else wants to answer this question, please do
i usually just write because planning takes me too much time and id rather use that time writing lmaoo
maybe my brain can subconsciously think while im writing the intro para and if it isnt thinking well, at least i can rest my hand while thinking instead of writing consecutively
also when i plan i change it half the time anyways
is anyone else here :((((
yeah!!! is anyone else here??? ;w;
s a m e
exactly! well at least i think thats how it works for me
also random q uhh do you have the file from niema's lecture? the one where he wrote out some stuff related to this assignemnt
i have it but my laptop cant open it and i wanted to use it as reference:/
did you mean the aps discussion yesterday? if so i didn't download any files, i just wrote down what was relevant to the questions and that was it lmao
ahh i remember he sent whatever he wrote on the whiteboard in chat but the file type (1a) is so strange
yeah sometimes you end up needing some weird thing to open files
i also noticed sometimes the files end up downloaded or uploaded as weird files
i litearlly just tried downloading a file viewer but it failed lmao
mhm i usually would screenshot but i forgot to figure out how to do this on my new laptop 🤡
the only stuff i have written down is that chart he drew of the 33 coin problem
oml i had to set up snagit on this laptop since it's new
i mean i also have the stuff he said about 1b + 1c
OH i just googled smth that helped but unfortunately it isnt what i expected it to be so the actual file was usless lmaooo
yeah i just got this lpaotp too and im used to mac controls since our school laptops were macbooks
yeah the windows computers have this built in screenshotter known as snipping tool
but i find it kinda tiring to use since i don't think it has a hotkey
so i had my dad download snagit since it lets me set a hotkey
so were you able to open the file or do you want me to share a pic of the notes i took lmao
ohh nice
i opened it so its all good :) ty tho lmao
okayyyyyyyyyyyy that's goodddd :3
mhm but now since ive forgotten math, i forgot how to write functions :')
functions like math functions
or functions like programming functions
i still kinda remember math functions
oh yeah i mean math functions right now like how we need to write an equation as a function of *n* lmao
do we actually?
e w
math
like parts 1e and 2e lmao i might be overthinking it tho
okay i just looked at the 1a chart
and i think my brain got it
wait jennyyyyyyyyyyyyy
which artists do you listen to
cause i remember when you messaged me you said something about my music taste
ahh sorry i was "working" on aps and got distracted lmao
nooooo it's all gooddddddddddd
o yes :)) i think you were listening to greatest showman atm
dw about it too much
ohhhhhhhh
greatest showman was so gooodddddddddddddddddddd
i also liked some other songs but i forgot what LOL
yesss the soundtrack is also so good
i know
it's just so pretty i-
i spent some of the time on aps but rn i've been renaming my playlists on spotify
and some of them have such dumb names now
about artists uhhh recently i havent been listening to english songs LMAO but i think i usually prefer ppl like ed sheeran lewis capaldi dean lewis etc etc those tpyes of songs... but i also have some strange tastes that dont match that at all
lewis capaldi
i swear he sings angst i-
omg i can spend hrs trying to sort playlists and stuff
also i felt that so hard
wait jenny have you heard some of the unreleased ed sheeran stuff?
LOL YES angsty songs are nice to make me feel a certain mood idk how to explain it
he was on yesterday and he kept saying he was gonna release these two songs from the film but he never did
i-
i was waiting for penguins and one life to become singles or something
and he never did
ok whattt i only know a few not on spotify but they were from ages ago
i used to be obssede w him
i just really liked those two songs in particular lmao
but havent been keeping up with new stuff unless its an album i spot on spotify lol
oo ill go listen to them then
they're only on yt tho
which suckssssssssss
i think the only unreleased songs i can think of are miss you and something about cutting your hair idr 😩
but i only really keep up with corpse at this point lmfao
ahhhh yeah sometimes i download local files but theyre all gone now since new laptop
man new laptops are such a pain
i see i see but tbh many corpse songs are too intense for me
so glad my dad loaded all the important stuff of mine onto a hardrive
fr!! but my school one was basically dead
that is so fairrrrrrrrrrr
:oo i was too lazy to do that
lmao
but yeah i def get corpse being intense
i think his least intense song is probably agoraphobic
mhm i rly like his voice but now i usually like softer songs
although he does have new stuff coming sometime
yeahhh ive listened to that one a few  times
soft songs are so niceeeee
oo ok i like taking a listen in case theres smth i can vibe w lol
i think i found most of my soft songs from one of those remix youtube channels
yes yes i think i realizd my fav genre is something i made up but wtv i call it melancholic ballads LOL
lmao ballads
i have this really random taste
at first it'll be k/da or something and then musicals and then sea shanties
omg k/da lol
okay but if you're into like bass singers
i have a rec, he does covers on youtube
and his bass is quite nice
yeah i think my taste is kinda random bc i do kinda listen all over the place
not like corpse deep
:o who?
colm mcguinness?
he looks familiar i feel like i mightve seen a vid before
but i dont usually find new music on youtube
i got a little too into sea shanties cause i was listening to reinaery
and then he showed up
i mean i learned a few on guitar years ago and wanted the nostalgia and then i got hooked to the bass
ive never heard of sea shanties lol
ohhh that makes sense
omg i just searched it and drunken sailor is such a throwback that song makes me laugh
i swear that song reminds me of my 6th grade days
and then country roads & green day's boulevard of broken dreams is elementary school
im prety sure i sang that song in choir in elem school or smth LMAO we were all like what the heck
omg i was in choir in elementary school tooooooooooooooooooooo
ahahah
ohhh i dont actually think i heard blvd til a few years ago
:o which choir lmao was it asian
nah it was school choir lmfao
i used to have to wake up so early for that
i remember we sang once upon a december from anastasia once
and back when 1D was getting huge, we sang a song from them
ohhhh ok
wait yeah so many elem school things were BEFORE school which is so </3
and we sang the christmas in whoville thing though i think we messed that one up a bunch during practice
i knowwww
it's so weird thinking about how i willingly woke up early
tbh i didnt know 1D til they disbanded bc so many classmates were dying during 7th grade about that band
LOL fr i dont think i did it willingly tho
parents probably made me
ahahahah
i don't remember why i did it
but we did sing a disney song
oo fun
omg i knew about 1D only cause we had to sing one of their songs and the daughter of the mom in charge of choir loved the band ig
which is how it ended up on our song lineup
thats kinda funny lmaoo choir singing 1D would normally seems trange
we sang it during springtime or something
i think it was "that's what makes you beautiful"
lmfao
oh gosh of course
thats the classic
NA NAN AN AN ANANAN
ahahahahahahahahah
my friend literally wrote a whole parody of that song but unfortualnyely i forgot all the lyrics
i swear things were so simple back then
no pandemic and less things to do
yes yes just everyting before hs tbh
honestly y e s
life was so fun pre-hs
then it was like 
lol most ppl were excited to go to college and i was like .. i want to go back to fun times in elem (even tho idk if they were fun LOL i just know things were easy and i knew how to do school)
exactly
ppl talking about how hs actually matters :S
high school's proper synonyms are pain and stress ahahah
lol facts!!
and also bad admin :')
y e s
oml it's like every day they wake up and choose to be blind
i-
yep yep litearlly yesterdays whole convo just further proved this smh
ig technically the day before yesterday
yeah technicallyyyy but also technicalities are kinda eh
agreed lmao
the only times i regonizie smth technical is when its past midnight and i reference the days wrong
ugh idek how to word that
honestly
i just considering morning whenever i wake up
:p
also like yeah, idk what it is with school and sketchy things lmfao
me too and people are like... no you sleep in the morning
n o
it's always whenever you wakeup
cause it's morning somewhere else in the world aaaaaaaa
yesssss because people dont rly call 12 am daytime so there isnt even a set thing anyways!
LOL TRUE
jenny did you got to a public school or a private school?
i swear most people i know always shit on private schools lmfao
oh i went to priv starting in 6th
oh wow that's pretty cool!!!
tbh i just say tuition isnt worth but im not mad my family sent me there lol
i think it really depends on the school tbh
the admin did many questionable things tbh but its not like publics were better
that's also a good point
like i remember people saying that harker was an academically strong private school
so many ppl in our school hated it tho because i went to a chrisitan school and many staff are old white males who lean very right
ohhhhhhhhhhhh
that is indeed a very awkward thing
i had a friend who went a catholic school and was like "i learned almost no science"
mhm mhm they pushed a lot of beliefs on people and there were a lot of controversial talks
ah yeah i think the biggest thing is evolution
yeah evolution is controversial, don't some states refuse to teach it?
we wer etaught the diff perspectives but it wasnt like unscientific at the same time and most other stuff was normal i guess
oh im not sure about that
but our teacher basically taught it and leaned twd evolution lol but its not like we were graded on what we believed in
i know some teachers are like you better have my opinion or else you fail
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh i felt that
i've had teachers like that and they are so difficult
yeahhh those teachers are irritating
i think i pissed off my 9th grade advisory teacher that way lmfao
most of mine werent like that though which i thought was nice
oop
i don't feel sorry at all though
i think he was a bit backwards to begin with
i dont actually know what advisory teachers do but he probably deserved it 😩
he was just supposed to help us get oriented during the first month of school
and i may or may not have said some interesting things that made him speechless
oh lmaoo did he not experience people who disagreed w him before or smth
well
i think it'll make more sense if i just say what happened
so he was talking about manners and stuff because i guess that's something he found really important and he was telling us about dating etiquette and i was like okay whatever
yeah and he stared at me flabbergasted as my friend and i burst into another round of hysterical laughter
and we never saw him again since advisory ended that day
LOL WHAT first of all thats a strange thing to say to a group of students but ok
yes go tel him the facts and i love that he just disappeared afaeirgg
ahahahahah he didn't disappear
we just never had to see him again cause advisory was over
i think since that day he never liked me as a student again though i'd never know cause he wasn't my english teacher
ohhh well thats a nice last impression you made :D
ahahaha i feel like if you had him as a teacher he would just feel awkward seeing you
lmfao it's one of the few times when i regret nothing
he was backwards in that sense and honestly it was kinda weird
i don't think people have to laugh with you, sometimes they can laugh at you
so hearing that was just weirdly very funny
mhm definitely i also just cringe hearing people give advice like that in the first place and i wish i could retort half the time
sometimes i do it without thinking
i mean in that situation i didn't have a choice cause everyone was staring lmfao
but still i think there are def times it's better to say nothing
i only have smart retorts if its w ppl im already pretty close with bc otherwise i probably wouldnt be talking
it takes so long to think of good ones
lol i bet the other ppl there were glad you said that
perhaps lmfao
at the very least, it made for an interesting final advisory
ahhh yes sometimes i think of good ones a literal day later completely randomly
oh definitely lol
i feel like since it takes so long to come up with retorts, i usually just end up saying exactly what i'm thinking
and then things like that happen
oh i cant relate but sometimes i wish i did that lmaoo
i felt that
i think the few times i *tried* to say what i was thinking just ended up so awkward and i just wanna go hide in a hole
there are times i strongly regret not saying something and being like "ur wrong"
that's such a mood though
wanting to say something and then panicking and changing it midway through
oh that happens to me way more but i think sometimes i just lose hope in ppl and just dont even try anymore if they say too many strange things that make no sense to me
!!! exactly
and half the time i say words that dont exist bc i combine 2 words-
gotta work on talking tbh
i love making portmanteaus
not me misspelling big words like portmanteaus
ok i like when i do it on purpose but not when its just me messing up a basic skill lolll
eh the meaning comes through anyways :))
talking is so hard sometimes i swearrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
t r u e
especially when you're trying to talk to someone for the first time????
like i get all anxious and panicky
its so strange i can just ramble on sometimes but only for specific ppl and i dont know the criteria for it and for others i just make so many speaking-typos
OH YEAH
omg speaking typos
ahah i'm probably gonna steal that ahahah
it makes talking in person so awkward for me im just like weiearhgoaengbeigierg
ahahahah i was trying to make a portmanteau w it but nothing sounds right
sometimes that happens
speakpo?? talkypo??
@jennosaur♡ @ragdoll kitten Hey guys, we're really glad that you're connecting, but maybe please move this convo to the dm's b/c it seems like it's been going on a while between just you too
omg i remember making portmanteaus of names too sometimes
okayyyyyy
ahhh ok
people feel free to join in tho it makes things much more fun :D
yeah we had a fun group yesterday ;w;
wish i coulda been there!
imagine telling us to go to game night but then not coming to game night
:(((
hey :(( i had a family thing
i promise next time!
family first!!! see u at the next one :) or else :)
oop or else
:)
bestie we know where each other live
threatening
bestie i believe in you
or else i will make you buy alvin an alvin and the chipmunks hoodie
wait actually thats a cute b-day present
oh do you guys know each other irl :o
yep! we had a math class together in high school
^^^^
thats cool! i dont know anyone from my school in anything related to cs at ucsd or else i would probably have bugged them to join spis lmao
guess why i applied to spis
oh love that
its ok jenny, when I was in spis I didn't know anyone at the school from irl, but it's worth the wait to meet everyone from spis on campus in a little over a month
it's gonna be so strange to see everyone irl :o hopefully i recognize people lmaoo
42 days to go
that sounds so far away
lmaooo same, i'm probably not going to recognize people since i usually remember their profile pictures :p
sounds so far away but i also cant believe school starts in a month
ikr! i blinked and summer was halfway done
yeah and i dont go memorizing people's faces on zoom either LOL
all the people i know from high school are going to college in like a week
ucsd supremacy
quarter system does weird things like that
quarter system supremacy
they'll be done in may and we'll be done mid june
idk about supremacy yet i'll decide after we actually start 🥴
quarter system inferiority 😔
quarter system is going to be kinda weird for me
i usually start in late august and end in mid may
lowkey haven’t had semester system since middle school
oh what did you do quarter system in hs?
yea
but it was 4 classes per sem, twice
kind of interesting
not very fun for aps
it seems like sm work to cram ap courses into "quarters" wow
it was kind of fine? it definitely was accelerated but like we had the class every day
hoping it’ll be a little similar in college
🤞 yeahh i think i might like the quarter system because of my work habits but gotta actually experience it to know!
from my experience i super love the quarter system!
it's DEFINITELY a lot sometimes but for me it's super nice because i like being able to move through things and it always feels like there's something new to do, which is especially nice for those GEs that are annoying
anyone have recs for good artists to listen to? i kinda wanna expand my horizons after corpse's b-day stream is over lmao
keshi n EDEN <333
mgk has some newer bangers
oml mgk!!!!! :3
grandson if you like indie rock!
i actually heard grandson on a mike shinoda track once, it was pretty great
glass animals

eden is a long time favorite
JEANNIE THIS IS AMAZING NEWS
https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/775661361187258438.gif?v=1
yeah if you're a fan of corpse you might have heard a glass animals song??? idk some got pretty viral online
lowkey what if we made a giant playlist with song recs
idk what the max number of songs on spotify is within a single playlist
but it does sound kinda fun
like finding out what that max is
heat waves got really popular for a while
i think i listened to eden since he was the eden project
+ take a slice
did you know that the end credits ep turned 6 today
dude shared spis playlist would be so fire i’d do it

Hmmm
mhm and tbh i havent listened to those lyrics deeply lmao
i think some of them are as pg as e-girls lmao
I tried to add mostly PG
I think Mustang Kids is the least PG of the ones I added
JENNY WAS THAT FORT MINOR I SAW
ooops
wrong person
so many people adding and i got everyone muddled
I MEAN T SAM
now i wanna add ghosts
If you like math and love you will like Asymptotic.
so many math terms lolll
It’s cute
FORT MINOR
i love seeing this tbh
Y E S
also
That ping is a lie >:O
did anyone add before you go yet?
uh oh spis bot
On gradescope it says it was due at 9 PM
i dont think so
that's the google calendar bot
i think it might be a webhook buuut idk
calendar bot also says 9pm but it broken
either way it's been kinda laggy
i've seen it do the 15 minutes before ping when there were literally 5 minutes left
i love before you go but didnt add it bc i feel like everyone knows it now ahaahah
We should do a Karaoke night
ADD IT ANYWAY JENNY
it's good
Then everyone can sing
just like lovely
rip the bot
sing? nah
Yes yes sing
n o o o o o i'll pass
ehhhh
Sing favorite songs over discord
Everyone at once
Perfection
OMG YES
that sounds amazing
that would be chaos but the fun kind
but i wouldnt want my family to hear me LOLLL
exactly
In choir we would do that for every birthday
pffft i don't think my family cares what i do anymore
they've heard me break out my growly "demon" voice enough times to be desensitized
that sounds fun!!!!!!!!!
Just don’t hurt yourself!
the lag would be so funny
Please protect your chords
wdym lmao
they don't get raw like they used to anymore ahahah
I mean demon voices that are too low can hurt you if you don’t do it properly
Like if you try screamo but don’t train for it
la devoteeeeee
You don’t want vocal nodes or something bad
Pain == bad
i don't do it often :3
i probably got used to it cause i used to overdo it as a kid once i realized i could
o gosh i like speaking strangely sometimes but its never too intense lol
sometimes my voice gets all growly for no reason lmao
As long as it doesn’t hurt or feel like there is a hole in your throat
and then i just make it a thing for the rest of the day
And don’t squish your vocal chords just let them be light and nice
i can't tell if i squish them or not lmao
If you have gravely voice my ears are crying
Like when you go squish on them
Like it’s all raspy and graveling and like
Squish
But it’s pressure on the chords >:O
ah yeah sometimes i get concerned hearing overly raspy voices
i can shift where it's getting growly now so i probably won't run into issues
Concern emoji
Please just be careful
And if it hurts you stop drink warm water with ginger and honey and lemon
i knowwww
Good good
i remember watching the gollum segment with andy serkis
XD
he said he did the gollum voice so much his voice was gone and they called it his gollum juice
You don’t wanna do that >:O
plus we'll both be at revelle lmaooooo
High pitch demon is just as terrifying as bass boosted demon
my voice can't go bass though lmfao
Sometimes more so if you add a scary cackle
ohhh that is so true
Mhm mhm
i bet it would have been hilarious if i used that voice in a haunted house at random
I do it when I wanna be spooky
SAMMMMMMMMMM
ALL TIME LOW?!!!!!
and dear maria count me in a t that!!!!!
agajklfdlasdfs
wait you can do it too???? exciting!!!!
Of course
ahhhhh we should do it together sometime ahahh
I played the grinch once and used the low demon voice for him and I cackle sometimes for funnies
Do you do accents too?
n o p e
We should do tongue twister games
i do animal noises though
Like I can say the Peter piper one in one breath
John would probably rock it
i caused a group of dogs to howl once
Oooh
I can’t do animals
i can kinda do them
I can do accents though >:D
which ones?
also sam i saw milky chance i-
so much good taste in one playlist
It depends sometimes but I’ve done Russian, Spanish, Australian, and English.
that is sooo cool
English and Spanish are easiest XD
what language did you take in school?
English as in UK btw not USA
Like southern accent, no no no
I took Spanish
oml sameeee
But I sing in Italian, French, German, Latin, Russian, Spanish, English, and other ones
that is super cool
Singing is best
https://tenor.com/view/anime-in-love-hearts-gif-10932413

https://tenor.com/view/umaru-sleeping-tired-exhausted-anime-gif-10119996

lmaoooo
If you pass out right now you get 8 hours
i found a song based off one of the campaigns
2 minutes for clothes and hair
itd be so cute to do a spis meetup once were on campus
Yes!
it wouldddddddddddd
but wouldn't that just be classes?
oh yeah that too
Not necessarily
but what if we’re not in the same 💔
Some of SPIS is undeclared or have other major requirements
true true
we should all meet up in the middle
which is probably like erc-muir area
i was thinking about that when people talked about seeing each other in person
if we actually arranged one it;d be a lot easier!
Geography is my worst nightmare I don’t know like anything about campus. I have to physically walk there to know
you and i can get lost together
i went on campus yesterday and got lost many times in the half an hour i was there 😩
Jenny you’re close?
if i'm allowed to give hugs, i wanna give hugs
I could see you
I’m actually meeting up with my partner on the weekend to hang out
Mwahahaha
Friendship
oh what thats so fun
but nopee
that's niceeeeeeeeee
i'm like in the bay area
i drove back to the bay today rip :(
Can I be the evil friendship person
Aww that’s far
I think
you can be whatever you want 😌
I don’t know where anything is
okay let's be real
8-9(?)ish hour drive
Yeah that’s far
i don't know where anything is within a 10 mile radius, much less further
We could meet halfway XD
:(((
i keep mixing downtown campbell with mountain view
LOL me geography actually sucks
im going to bay area ish in a week (?) or so
I know how to get to work, high school, maybe middle school, and like vons. But if you ask me to go anywhere else I need a GPS
two weeks ish
felt that
i only figured out a few cities around me bc one of my friends had to drive to pick ppl up
woah :O
omg zoe same
i know where almost nothing is
i probably couldnt do that tbh and i cant even drive LOOL
omg jenny same
Oh
i don't have my license
wait sam why are you comin to the bay thats cool!
it's a crash course, but with actual crash
literally ! im the oldest of a lot of friends but theyre all licensed
we r moving my brother into college :)
I can drive every kind of car basically cause I learned how to drive the minivan. So I know how to do big and small cars
zoe knows how to drive, zoe is cool
ooo makes sense
And I’m responsible so you know… I could like take you to the beach or something
i can barely drive at 0 mph in a tiny corolla
omg you can drive multiple cars i dont even know what types of cars there are
I’ve driven people to Disneyland to celebrate graduation and stuff ? And like long drives I’ll switch with my mom to help out.
oml DISNEYYYYYYYYYYYY
I don’t know types of cars I just know there are big and small cars
thats so fun
i don't even know where the bumper is when i'm behind the wheel and my parents were just like "but ur just supposed to *know*"
tbh i used to get the brake and gas pedals mixed up so im scared of the driver seat
That’s so dangerous
my brother really roasted me for mixing them
You just have to feel it
its ok i havent actually driven
Like you just gotta know
like i wasn't behind the wheel but i guessed wrong :p
But parking in a big car is a nightmare
only in an empty parking lot once and sometimes around where i live when theres no one
so i've heard
esp on hillsides and parallel
sam you're coming to the bay?
yes
i am going to berkeley tho
!! exciting
I have to parallel park sometimes and every time I’m like please kill me
ohhhhhhhhhh berkeley
less exciting
also im still going to be doing spis while im there 😂😂
LOL
SF IS NIGHTMARE PARKING ZONE
So true
ew sf parking
oh fun spis when not at home gets annoying bc my family always interrupts and stuff
Parking is so scary cause like you could hit a car
And die
i always get so anxious when my dad's like trying to park
wait where in the bay are y’all
san jose
bay area is so wide
sf is a nightmare so we just use the caltrain
i have a friend going to berkeley
im next to great america
WOW
im in like cupertino
bart n all of the buses <33333
wait jenny i kinda know where you are lmao
XD
You could all meet up
Wild
yes
yeahh i realize that using great america/levis stadium is a lot easier than saying the city LOL
we couldddd but would we?
truee
hmm
👀
Just plan it and do it
Then obligations
we can keep it a maybe
oh
Easy force yourself to have fun
EVIL FRIENDSHIP
lmaoooo
Mwahahaha
but if we do a big discord hangout then more people could joinnn
that sounds like it might hurt
im too bad at social interactions so uhh
we love access
and no one would have to leave the house
and no sunlight
exactly
me who had huge ulterior motives
no vitamin d
guys sunlight is good for you
Fair enough
i've been getting freckles from just standing outside for five seconds
Vitamin d deficient gang?
n o
what if we waited until campus
but then got food
OMG YESSSS ZOE YES
ayy
yep!
XD
i have to take a giant pill bottle
i love food
of supplements
you jus reminded me i have to take a pill
food is so good
Doctor always tells me to take vitamins and I forget every morning
ME
zoe where is the good food in ucsd
take us there
oo yes show us around
Idk I haven’t been on campus since middle school only virtual tours during quarantine
Ask John
oh actually, what about around ucsd
@John._. I humble-y ask you to describe UCSD food
is he even on though lmao
UTC has lots of options
did u know that 6th (?) has a balcony cafe thing
i only know theres a westfield something and theres boba !
ooh really?
UTC it is!
westfield!!!! i love westfield utc
yea rooftop right?
It’s like a mall with boba and stuff
it has so many options
ohh yes
the only feature of ucsd i know of is the aquarium about a mile south of revelle
it is very large
XD
and then off campus there's a tidepool like 5 miles away
i always think of valley fair -> westfield then i forget the name
Tide pools are amazing
LMAO I LIVE HERE AND I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF THIS
lmao yea valley fair
everything else, i'm just going to wander around until i find it
OMG THAT MALL
we should wander around together sometime
There is boba on campus and a little shop and lots of libraries
The quiet levels are super quiet though
but is the campus boba any good
oh right, there's supposed to be a target somewhere according to my mom
I know they have treadmill desks
wait boba on campus? do you know if we can use dining dollars
around price center right
ah yep i saw the target when i went
I don’t know, and it’s tapioca express idk if you want that
yes!!! target is near center of campus/geisel/price center
at the very worst, if the boba sucks, we could always buy the boba from ranch 99 and make the tea
Maybe in a pinch it would be good
lmao
XD
hmm yeah
we should organize supply runs
I like ding tea the most
since we cannot have cars
WE REALLY SHOULD
ok if we can use dining dollars then i would probably get it too much since i need to use those up anyways
XD
lowest dining plan gang
Me
ahahahah
same
i got the higher dining plan
oh true im not sure how people get around there
whatt ive never heard anyone do that lol
buses and shuttles
and idk maybe scooters
I got the lower one and I hope the people who live near me will let me make pizza for them
apparently there's a decent italian cafe thing across the road from seventh that takes dining dollars
i remember that ucla had a billion of them lying around
PIZZA
my favorite food
so you know what im going to be spending my dd's on
We make homemade pizza at home
pizza <3
did any of your parents tell you about the freshman 15?
!!!
I just throw vegetables on it
zoe that sounds funnnnnnnnnnnnn
oh true there are bikes/scooters i think but theyre pay er use or smth?
But it’s customizable
we gotta hang out lots at revelle zoe!!! :3
Will you be my pizza buddy
i went to ucla for a two week summer program and gained like 8 pounds lmao
it was so bad
We can have pizza on fridays or something
SURE :3
And hang out!!!

Yeee

my parents keep being like watch you gain 50 instead of 15
but i also have disordered eating sooo
i will run down to revelle for pizza
oh gosh yeah freshman 15 scares me ahahah
YES EXERCISE
We can make lasagna too probably …. That’s pretty easy and feeds lots of people
aerin why are we the same </3
pasta?
i made pasta today
we still need to go to ethan’s dorm and have zoe teach us how to make pizza
i know how to make those packaged japanese curries
and lasagna

Ooh and chik pea curry

Cooking is one of my favorite pass times
It’s so relaxing
i applied for a single apartment
ohh wait not all dorms do right?
I made banana bread on Thursday and baguette yesterday
YOOOOOO
i wanna bake cookies
ME
omg i can make cookies
What kind of cookies??
i used to be such a mystery to my old classmates
they didn't know my birthday
i love this
my plan to reinvent my personality to be cool and mysterious is falling apart before my eyes
ZOE MAKES AMAZING COOKIES
thats kinda me online lmao
@ferreti was I ever mysterious?
respectfully, no <3
XD
LOL
p much no one knew a thing about me until like now???
I’m too bubbly I guess
wait zoe sam do you guys know each other irl
my bokuto switch got flipped
We went to high school together
that is so niceeee
Sam is amazing

10/10 fantastic beautiful sweet Angel
aw cute
Sam and I did senior sunrise together
i skipped mine
And we took pictures!
but that sounds hella cutee
:o pics!
i didnt even have a senior sunrise rip
my hs did but i also was like nah
omg wait
oooh cuteeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
there was no sunrise 💔💔 but lots of friends
I had to screenshot cause literally my phone is a potato
CUTE!!
ahahahah i saw a sunrise from trying out an all nighter for fun
we had a senior sunset
im in white, zoe’s in the black and pink flower hoodie
You guys got pancakes !
I like hoodie
but i have mild trauma associated to it so i pretend it does not exist
zoe your hoodie is cuteeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
i love ur hoodie
^^
uh oh
we did get free boba and a blanket tho so that was cool
i block all memories of the single high school homecoming i attended
omg the last time my school gave boba out, it was the default kind
they gave us gamer lookin headsets for a silent disco at ours
and it had a funny black tea taste
....d-default kind?
i cant remember anything from the one hoco i attended so i wonder if there was some trauma i literallyforgot about
it was that basic looking brown one like the emoji
so regular black tea probbaly
that is terrifying
okay but why not the ones with cat ears
I think my hoodie has Spanish and Chinese on it XD so it’s perfect for me
thats what im sayin >:(
i only knew silent headphones existed this year at our formal thingy lol
also me: has done the same halloween costume countless times
i'm unoriginal as heckkkkkkkk
hate to say it but i dont think ive had a costume in yearssss
okay but would trick or treating be something college students do
that looks fun
Yesss
Was fun!
i skipped all the social events for my 11th and 12th grade for good reason lmao
XD
You should gooo
It’s fun to do those things
hopefully you didnt miss out on much
mm covid
i doubt it, i had a pseudo stalker at the school events
i only went bc i know i wouldnt ever have a chance to do something like that again
Im lucky cause I went to prom freshman and sophomore year lol
ah.
Oh. Police?
ohhh that's nice
we never got a prom lol
Body guard?
nah there were other people who reported the dude and nothing happened
our school doesnt believe in proms 🤡
Fight? I will?
i forced myself to go to the senior events bc i didn’t go to any of the other ones throughout hs
oh its that frkn guy ugh
yeah lmao
I liked seeing you!
my school did proms, but they were like at golf courses or something
it was weird
That does sound weird
i liked seeing you too zoe!!
❤️❤️❤️
hopefully they were fun :))
???? what u gonna do at a golf course huh
golf
yeah my one event i went to was on a literal farm lol
no!
@ragdoll kitten I suggest restraining order if he ever does that again
also anyone else who's online and looking at this chat! don't be a stranger!!!!!
oh he's going to sjsu
Lol they’re like GO TO BED
and he's probably going to stalk all the poor girls at bus stops
:p
I updated my pins
ohhh cuteee
Because I got San Diego safari park pins
WAIT
I JUST SAW THE UP PIN
ahdfjkaslfsdf
OOF THE SNOOPY SCHOOLBUS
omg i love the green one on the middle/bottom right
He’s sideways
i collected pins a long time ago
waittt i went to the san diego safari a few days ago lmaoo
omg baymaxxxxxxxxx
That’s a kopporkur I think from ff14
Spelling is hard
aw the rainbow sd zoo elephant one is v cute
i also reallly like that purple cat one
They also had a lion but you know, knowing they have six sets of teeth that come out of their mouth like a conveyer belt convinced me.
I also got elephant poo paper!
That’s one of two! I have the other to my best friend let me find a photo.
i heard there was lemur poop coffee
should i know what elephant poo paper is-
i think i've heard of it
but i also know a lot of really random and weird things
OMG
those!!!!
waooo i love those
i love them
Elephant ooo paper is paper made from elephant poo, it’s like reusing and a bit novelty
Elephants are awesome they have such cool facts
oh that sounds so strange lol
But giraffes are my favorite
i had a floriography phase so i definitely have uselessly weird knowledge
I volunteered at the San Diego Safari Park XD
lmao giraffes, sorry there was gartic phone earlier today with giraffes on a stream lmao
OH THAT SOUNDS FUN
I was part of the educational department for conservation
Yeee
that is super cool!!!!!!!!
It’s why I know so many animal facts XD
giraffes are v cool
Like California condors have an awesome conservation story
:nyasGiraffe1:
Lol
lmaooo i know some human anatomy facts, symbolism and like other useless things
i feel like animal facts are more useful
@jennosaur♡ i just noticed but i love ur profile background
Giraffes’ fun fact of the day is for every inch on their tongue that’s a foot in height
that is cooooooooool
Giraffe babies come out 6 FT tall
And their hearts are the size of a 20 pound bowling ball
oh wow i wish i knew cool facts but my memory just doesnt work sfkdjfnks
They have 7 vertebrae just like us!
so you're telling me they're about as tall as the average height of exes (probably)
They’re super cool
What does this mean
HEHE TY i love it
3/4 exes were at least 6ft or taller
Exes like Exe partners?
yep
Or is this a band
Ohh
ah
where are you finding these giraffe partners
Imagine dating
ikr LOL
pls advise
No advise for me
XD
i don't even find em, they find me
asking for a friend
I don’t wanna date
oh
same here zoe!!
although i'm way better at advice for bad ppl to not date lmfao
i would like to date 👉👈
it's okay jenny and zoe, if you both need hugs i'll give them all to you
https://tenor.com/view/gabriel-dropout-anime-happy-gif-8661798
(also your cat pins are like the ace flag which makes me love it more)
I support you queen!
yay :))) will lyk if i need a hug any day
yes sam
i support
You can date to your hearts content
My advice as someone who has a sister who dates
yesss go find yourself good people tho
You should trust your instincts and just be upfront about it
YES
and if you need advice on bad vibes people, i got u
Because I don’t understand the avoiding it thing, just go for it.
commitment is hard!!! and talking!!!!
i have met so many bad vibes ppl so i kinda developed a bit of a radar
omg this
I love talking
t r u e
and then if you have trust issues & stuff it gets even harder
It’s my favorite pastime second time singing
lmaooo dw zoe, you match my energy
give me your confidence please even just a tiny bit
Who hurt you? Was it the group projects?
talk as much as you want with me
i had some pretty terrible friends for a really really really long time lmao
You need confidence to sing in front of 200+ people
You can do it
Just open your mouth and breathe!
ugh that sucks hope you cut them out
oh my no never for me ahahaha
not the group projects 😭😭😭
oh i did lmao
I also hope they’re not there no more
The group projects of dooom
lmao my group projects went good cause i found decent people who did their parts lmao
I remember in biology I accidentally did a whole group project on my own because I wanted to be ahead on the homework
https://tenor.com/view/confused-white-persian-guardian-why-gif-11908780
My teacher was so confused XD
i only like group projects when we can pick and i actually have friends im compatible w/ in the class
LOL
lmaooo my teachers probably question how i get good grades
i slept through a lot of some of my classes and still had as :3
Nah you’re smart
hi
respectfully, this is such a you thing to do
HI
Hi Jeremy
Good morning!
Im Jeremy
it's not morning
hi joe
not until we wake again
hi jeremy
good morning :)
I know! XD
Who's Joe?
lmaoo zoe dont say the am s are all morning :o
I’m sleepy but also energy!
But they are?
joe politz <333
at 12 am, my chaotic energy switch just kinda flips
its ok we don’t do filters here
12 am isnt the morning though!!!
and then i have a hard time stepping away from conversations and actually sleeping
it’ll get lost anyway
It’s morning?
LOVE THIS
n oo
its not like many of the mentors/lurkers will actually read
Yes
YES
pffft you wouldn't know that
IT IS THE AM
no
its like how 12 pm isnt night
i remember it was like 1-2 am a few days ago and josh joined us
so :3
Good morning GOOD MORNING duh duh duh duh duh GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING TO YOU
i hope i'm not scaring anyone who's still awake lmfao
page 1 of 34
i don't even drink coffee because caffeinated tea does a number on me
its been an hour n and a half
strong x to doubt
oh
it's night somewhere else in the world
wait i still remember when it turned to midnight
p sure there were convos before that as well
Wanna know a secret
this is a mood
I read your guys messages when I wake up
ahahahahh
Ha ha
i slept so much in spanish my teacher pulled me aside and asked if i had issues at home
😥
dude i just wanna sleep
zoe knows stuff about me that i dont remember saying now!!
also ur class was boring x
you should have said you had issues with the school lmao assigning so much hw
SAME
i just brainlessly talk and then it disappears
i am dory
short term memory loss gang <3
oh my im annoyed i used to try to sleep in class but i'd fail lmaoo
lmao i also have long term memory loss
i just have memory loss
yep
:')
yes
yikes my guys
i slept through my english and it did *nothing*
I can’t sleep in class
I can’t sleep in bed sometimes
And I can’t nap
same zoe it sucks
XD
oh i started napping when quarantine became a thing
bc i'd sleep at 7 am and have to wake up for school or smth at 7:55
i just get those random moments when i'm super tired
like you know how cats fall asleep in the afternoon
When I nap I wake up angry and in pain
So it’s not worth it
yeah i got to be really careful about my afternoons
i feel this so hard
wait whyyyyyyyyyyy?
that is true sometimes but i still do it anways ahaha
i feel like im more tired after sleeping but its not like i'd have been doing anytihng productive
this is probably part of the reason why the whole "aerin is a cat" thing started in the first place i-
I don’t know why? I wake up from naps with headaches and I clench my jaw and even if I’m in bed I wake up just angry
awwwwwwwwwwww
do hugs make you less angry ?
oh no that sucks :((
i swear quarantine did a number on me and my brain flipped upside down
Sometimes, it depends on the vibe. If I’m working and you hug me I’ll be like bro I love you but now ain’t a good time
i only get angry if ppl wake me up for no reason during my naps
XD
i used to be like hisss hugs
same same
I give hugs out like it’s no ones business
now i'm like i will give everyone hugs if they want em as long as they're not creepy
@ferreti remember?
yes <3
I’d hug all our friends good morning
and i also have become exceedingly overaffectionate and talkative
ahahh
tahts cute tho !
i love giving hugs
i remember i had a hugging phase once
Hugs are so nice
XD
Jenny is like ask me before for hugs please
i can never get out of the getting hugged phase
and people started being so annoying bc i hugged a guy. just because he was a male.
i like to ask before b/c i know some people are like really uncomfy
i had a guy friend and people kept saying he liked me
Yeah what I do is ask if they’re comfy with hugs and then they’re like YEE or nah, then I will like high five them instead.
Accommodation for affection
Y E S
yeah i think usually there are a few people i always hug when i see but for others, gotta at least ask the first time or be close lol
i am also really the type to randomly say "i love you platonically" to people
we love consent
just to remind them they're loved
WE REALLY DO
Bro I love you
🥰
i love you too (platonically)
Ha ha XD
oh thats kinda awkward
i tack on platonically unless i mean it otherwise
love you guys no romo !!
Imagine that XD
because i don't want misconceptions
What kind of banana
LOL
some people think i send hearts because i like them, like no i send them to everyone ❤️
Lol
oh yeah and i friendzoned him so hard at that time lmfao
Imagine having this much game
wdym lmao
fr lmaoo
The ability to worry about this stuff seems intense
i didn't even know i was friendzoning but eh
ohhh well i've had some weird cases where people did weird things
i dontsend hearts all that often but i kinda adapt to the person so if someone is a heart sender ill start doing it too
for example, i was volunteering at my school art show and being nice cause well i was volunteering and this senior started hitting on freshman me
um
Get ready for me ❤️
I love gifs and emojis
once i get comfy with people i do it often
❤️ ok
SAME
i find it too hard to find gifs
💜
i only find the ones with hearts
Bro I went to prom freshman year with a junior and I didn’t realize he asked me out ?
i used to emoji a LOT tho but i get lazy if i dont know the name of it
oh-
the dude even offered to take me home it was like wayyy too far
Anyways awkward for him cause I apparently broke his heart.
ooof but i am equally easily confused too
THIS BAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAH I FELT SO HARD
i just don't get it
I’m so thick headed I can’t even tell.
did you think you were going as friends
ME
Yeah. XD
love y’all no romo <3
<3333
people really have to tell me otherwise i'm just like cool ig
Cause he was my friends friend. So I was like: sure? FRIENDSHIP
lmaooooo
yeah apparently im rly oblivious when it comes to me but not others
🤔
FRIENDSHIP!
y e s
honestly i just can't read people well
i dont know how my skills are anymore ive forgotten what things were like before
I can’t tell when people are joking or not
sameeeeeeee
And like slang is really difficult for me sometimes
SAME
and those weird emoji paragraphs?
Like SMH is not the sound “Smuh” it’s shaking my head
LOL
i really went and googled like "what does this emoji mean"
And I learned “cap” means like to lie
i pronounce it smuh in my head
Me too
i didn't even know what cap meant
It’s like
Lie?
you cappin
its strange
So people say: no cap
And it’s like no lie? That’s true?
i only know cuz one frined used it in every other sentence or smth
but lie is also 3 letters?
I know
It’s funky
people just wanna sound cool or somthing
i always end up being like "what do you mean"
yk i just started using cap without actually ever knowing what it meant
Mood
and then people are like "awww you don't know" as if it's cute i didn't get it
at this point im too afraid to ask
i just ask because i really live under a rock sometimes
google is a freind
That happens to me too much.
i swear people are just like ur so cute
Aerin and I are being best friends
i say a lot of people are cute so
besties ✌️
yall cute
I feel like I’m betraying my programming partner
i had a former classmate who would take a bunch of photos of me b/c they thought i was cute/pretty
and like i-
Rena I love you and you’re an Angel
Shouldn’t they ask you first?
it was weird knowing that they had a whole album with pictures of me and they were candids
idk it was middle school
thats kinda strange
^
i kinda just got used to people kinda doing things like that without asking lmao
Noooo!
Don’t let people do that to you.
bad.
lmaooooooo
It’s illegal to take someone’s photo.
uhhh are you ok with it now? or just ppl youre already friends with
i mean i can't controll them lmfao
normalizing it does not make it right </3
i knowww
But you ask them to delete it
It’s like with my job and creepy men
But don’t be like me
I can’t like get mad at them cause I’m at work
honestly i hate that
But you’re not at work, so get mad.
the whole if you're at work you can't tell someone they're being a bad human
summon ur inner girlboss
get a $7 machete at ross
LOL
lmfao
Just carry around my bow?
nah my solution is usually find someone intimidating and stay around them
Like the archers
i really went to google machete at ross to see the price lmaoo
I WENT TO ROSS
SLIGHTLY NEAR UCSD
lmaooooo
FOUND A $7 MACHETE
FOR REAL
wha t
have you found one yet in spis lmaoo
oh my gosh
the last time a saw a machete was in back for blood
no, i pick based on height
I keep getting self defense advertisements like the bracelets and necklaces that make alarms and send your location to police and family
Or like these kitty knuckles
although i had a short friend (the one going to u of t) who is intimidating because computer skills
lmao how are u supposed to pick based on height thru the computer 😭😭
ooh the brains are intimidating too
exactly
aerin youre taller than me you can be my intimidating bodyguard :oo
but i do get curious about people's height
im 5’8
I think I can be intimidating
i coulddd
@ferreti can confirm?
Am I intimidating?
eh
lmaoooo zoeeee
so talll
yeah sam is really talllllllllllllll
https://tenor.com/view/puppydogeyes-cute-hair-gif-5439366
i'm a whole five inches shorter
i think u have the potential to be
but are not
honestly i can really scare people
Awww
but for the wrong reasons
I’ll just get angry, angry people are intimidating.
i can keep my face expressionless for a really long period of time
some people are cute angry
i think i creeped out a teacher with that
I don’t think I’m cute angry.
i usually fall under that category
but there have been times i actually scared people
oh in middle school i would scare seniors or wtv bc i used to apparenly glare a lot
ahahahahah
If you glare at me I’d probably cry XD
i am a huge crybaby too
I don’t want people to hate me
we'll see in person how you guys are when you get angry *maybe*
But if you’re zoning out I zone out at my brother all the time
when i'm getting confused or flustered or trying to make a point
i just end up crying
I hope you never see my angry.
i cant glare scarily anymore lol yeah i just zone out
i hope i dont eitherrr
Mood
idk there's my cute angry
and then there's my seething, actually terrifying angry
usually i fall in the cute angry where people don't take me seriously
i just tear up whenever im talking with an authority figure its so annoying
oh i just have no expression when i talk to authority figures
Parents and talking about an opinion that differs.
ugh thne people think that its just a joke or youre not actually mad and its annoying
my facial muscles just kinda die
hate this
omg this is asehgorgsgrog
When does that go away? XD
mhm and they just think they did nothing wrong if youre mad at them
when my facial muscles are dead people are always like "i can't read you" but i also don't care enough to actually idk express myself
When can we have normal conversations with our parents
rightttttttttttt
and then i'm like okay i'll just be petty
i have 0 idea if i ever will tbh
but i also don't have enough energy or ability to be petty enough
yeah i cannot express myself i used to be expressionless/glaring 24/7
i felt that
why is that such a mood
like im petty but then i just dont even think its worth it anymore
i didn't glare but i had no expressions because idk that's how i hung out with toxic people
i wanted to be petty with my mom's high school classmate but don't have the energy to
oh parent friends are a different story
i try to stay away unless i know them lmao
well she approached me
told me i "looked lonely" and told me dw her daughter will keep me company next time
and i almost lost my self control
why would she do that
i just kinda wanted to cuss her out but like idk
well it was all boys
see my mom's hs best friend has 2 sons
that other woman had a son there
and i have my brother
so i was the only girl
but that lady's daughter is a literal child & i'm an adult
plus i've hung out with the other 2 boys plenty of times???
ugh ok yeah people who butt in when youre just minding your own business
irritating
i know right
like theres a difference between being friendly and just being
i was gonna swear but her kid is 12
idk
pushy?
i was thinking ppl who impose their opinion on you but thats also kinda specific lol
ah was her kid around?
just her son
either way i was like i have my bloody boundaries!!! i learned that from therapy!!!
so like reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
idk what it is with some asian moms and boundaries
it happens too often
they think that since they know you in some way they have all rights
i know which is why i was going to be petty and not respect her since she didn't respect me as an 18 year old
welp will you have to see her anymore?
idk i don't really want to hang out with her children lmfao
idk
if i do, i'll have to think of a good roast
yeah lol thats just kinda awkward
i'll find out on thursday or friday this week if we have to see them this weekend
oo plan some in advance
hope you dont 😩
ahahah me too me too
also good night zoe maybe
okay we should really sleep
yes goodnight zoe
hope shes sleeping
actually really, goodnight everyone
yeah we probably should
because we have class at 8 tomorrow ahahahahahah

omg house of memories is soooooo good
aww omg
welp guess we;ll find out when we get there!!
AH I LOVE THAT ONE ZOEEEEEE
i love that so much
https://tenor.com/view/heart-cat-kitty-cute-gif-11087999
and yess house of memories is a bop :D
honestly once i got hyperaware of cats, i realized there are actually a lot of cats near my house
oo we have a few cats running around but i only hear them at best
https://tenor.com/view/love-lick-kisses-cute-cats-gif-12418179
AH ZOEEEE THAT"S SO CUTE TOO
how are their faces so flat
theyre so cute ;-;
whenever i see cats or dogs i just feel really happy
same
However the conservationalist in me gets sad vibes from the flat faces because of the health conditions and concerns based around it...
literally! there are the cutest vids everywhere
oh no are flat faces always bad for the cat?
i think it's kinda like the whole thing with bulldogs and it being hard to breathe
i remember people also said that munchkin cats with super stubby legs are concerning too
most purebred cats have issues cause well,,, inbreeding
aw :( i dont actually see many animals irl so when i do i never really pay attention to that but ugh hope people will take care of their pets
The issues are like, you wanna drink water as a dog or cat with a flat face you can drown. They tend to have more biological/genetic issues because of inbreeding and because their gene pool becomes weaker. It's just not good because the birth defects or health problems can make the animal miserable. xD
honestly i like mixed breeds more for that very reason
It's just important to know these sorts of things if you want to adopt an animal or rescue an animal you know about possible health concerns and stuff.
plus they're actually v v v cute
You know whats not cute?
Trying to figure out your 4 year plan and then realizing that some of it needs to be changed because the advisor was like: that isnt allowed.
So now I am moving everything
that aint cute.
girl it's so confusing
imma cry with it fr like omg
omg that is really not cute
oh no what
how is it not allowed
i'm going to have to meet with two different ones cause of my weird situation
I have to take certain courses before others
ahh prereqs
and I overlapped them on accident
ohhhhhhhhh
wait zoe did you already set up your courses?
i mean my cogsci just has a bunch of prereqs and a math class or maybe a million i have to take
yeah i didnt plan enough to have that problem yet
then i'm onto upper division stuff
wait what spec are you in cogsci aerin
machine learning & neural comp
GIRL
me too LMAO
omgggg we can suffer togetherrrrr
FR LMFAOOO
i didnt choose that bc i dont want more math classes LOL
i mean i did calc ab ;w;
i did calc ab y but that's only cus i took accelerated precalc or whatever
i skipped precalc trig at my school b/c i could
oh bet
our school had this weird setup where if we took a specific math class we could skip that part so i did
and i took precalc trig concurrent and remembered nothing
but calc a went just fine
i think ours is like alg 1 > geo > alg 2 > precalc ??? but it depends where u start as a freshman
oh we were on the integrated math system so it went something like
ooh what i've never heard of that fr
oh we had int 1 > int 2 > int 3 > precalc or calc
lmao or the honors sequence
then AB and BC in one year 💀
i feel like doing ab bc in a year is nice since you'd only need 1 ap test, the bc one
Do any of the mentors here recommend Math 18 linear algebra or Math 31AH honors linear algebra. Just wanted to get some insight
The honors class is much more difficult from what I'm aware. I think in most cases you should consider the regular path, and only go towards the honors if you have a specific want to do so, rather than considering it as an alternative option
Okay thanks Josh! I heard it was more theoretical and proof-y
nasty stuff
Yup exactly, but it *also* covers all of the main content too, so it's significantly more work
No problem!
i keep saying this but i really love this playlist
jennyyyy your lewis capaldi just came on and it's so goooddddddddd
doesn't this kinda look less like a robot and more like a creepy grin?
I agree
now that you're pointing it out im scared
ahahaha which is exactly why i had to change my profile picture lmao
i kept seeing it as a creepy grin and it bothered me
shit why did you have to tell me
here

@Younus You were telling our group the right answer we shoulda listened to you >:O
Been bamboozled, we thought we could mix to create the optimal solution.
It was a lie.
Getting the right answer is only part of it, it's the process. Better to try out different solutions too 😤

@jennosaur♡ ILYSM for adding so many songs also i love "got it in you" by banners i-

hi jennyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
i love that song too and theyre literally underrated
hiiii :D
i heard that song on good doctor!!
ooh i havent watched(?)
i really like medical shows, i think it started from when i was a kid
my grandma had no idea what i was watching, but i ended up this old medical examiner show on discovery that was actually not my age... i think that't when it started lmfao
oh wow ive barely seen medical stuff because blood and everything just makes me shriek lmaoo
how's everyone doing? and please join us, we can talk about literally anything
i got so traumatized by monsters inside me or something
my sister likes greys anatomy and sometimes she pauses it on a literal cut open stomach just to show me i-
i- 
parasites 🥴
r i g h t ?
grey's anatomy be graphic lowk
I K R she hasnt watched recently so she hasnt been doing that lol but she gets queasy easily as well so i dont even know why shes so obsessed
hi alex :D
hi!!!
hi alexxxxxxxxxx :3
hi aerinnnnn!
ngl the only grey's anatomy i knew for the longest time was that old medical textbook
i only know the tv show lmao
opposites
didnt even know there was a textbook lmao
who put chasing fire by lauv? it's so nice
wait wouldn't it show the pfp of the person that put it there
yeah i think the show's name is from the textbook
there are 162 songs, i don't really wanna scroll :3
oo me :) i think song got me into lauv!!
i think the first time i heard lauv was when he did a song with troye sivan
i think if you click on the picture it jumps to the place in the playlist (if youre on desktop)
ohhh im so tired right?
probably?? i haven't heard that song in forever tho
i had my troye sivan phase in 8th grade or something
it's been years
i forgot it existed til that was mentioned
oh i feel like so many people had that phase lmao some of my friends used to be obessed
i did lowk LMAO
middle school
lmao middle school
i like strawbs and cigs the most hehe
nostalgia really hits now ahahahahah
fr when i was scrolling through songs i heard some that i completely fogot about for years!
SAME
we rediscovering fr
it's like discovering ancient history istg
LMAO yuppp
LOL ikr and sometimes i cringe thinking about specific phases
fr fr
i'll be like w h y
felt
like when i dug out/rediscovered the bracelets i bought years ago for bands i no longer listen to i-
going through my liked songs @ the bottom is an interesting journey
i didn't realize how long i've been using spotify lmfao
omg im glad i never bought merch or whatever but i know friends whove had to tear down posters regretting their decisions ahahah
samee omg my first playlist was 2016
i had a highly regrettable purchase when i bought a bunch of black butler posters
lmaooo i only bought shirts but never posters
ah did you get over it?
i never hung up the posters and i'm not about to take them with me to college aaaaaa idk what i was thinking
that too
ohhh
now i have haikyuu stickers :3
i want haikyuu stickers so bad lol
do you think one day youll be over haikyuu :o
i have the kind you can stick on the back of a card
bet
don't think so?
i mean i've always loved ghibli and i watched it ages upon ages ago
plus i got into haikyuu in 8th grade lmfao
ghibli is a good memory for me i havent watched any of the films in so many years
i really wanted a nostalgia trip so i watched ponyo + totoro this summer
omg studio ghibli
i couldnt imagine 😩 but new stuff is still coming out right?
y e s
i think so?
i lowkey cant even remember which ones ive seen but i just remembered that i liked watching them-
aw shucks i thought my new favorite animated movie in japanese was by ghibli & it's not
which movie?
the boy and the beast
i thought of a really random question
do you remember which disney princess you wanted to be when you were a kid?
i think belle
omg belle!!! that's a good one :3
yessir
probably mulan tbh but it was more just admiration  ahahah
mine was snow white i think
oo a classic
tbh i thought most of their lives were too sad
yeah it's really old now that i think of it
fr they areeeeeeeee
like what they had to go through early on doesnt really disappear bc they have a happily ever after 😩
oml that's my gripe with so many storiessssssss
like now that i'm older and life happened, you end up being like why did they just magically get better and how?
exactly! and arent the original brothers grimm ones all really sad or something
they gotta appease the children i guess
not just sad but also morbid af
yeah gotta keep it pg
disney censorship
oh yeah that would NOT do well with kids or their parents
if i remember right, the original grimm's brother tale the mermaid dies and becomes seafoam
it's the premise ponyo is set around
not the whole dying thing though
mhm something like that
that's the only one i actually slightly recall
it was really a dead dove: do not eat
wait which one?
what does that mean uhhh is it a reference or some new slang
ah the little mermaid grimm version
dead dove: do not eat is a tag people use for fanfiction and works that are pretty much as labeled to warn readers that all the tags on the work are indeed as dark as the author has indicated
it's kind of a read at your discretion tag
it was taken from a tv show i think
ohhh
makes sense lol
ohhh fs
lmaoo i know really useless things ahahah
nahh knowing the meaning of warnings is usually a good thing lmaoo
(at least if you read works like that)
sometimes it makes you wonder though
like the chemical hazards signs, does everyone actually know how to read that stuff?
i mean  i had to for school
eh- i just know those signs mean it's dangerous but not specfic meanings hehe
should be alright if i avoid anyways? 😳
yeah! the signs just specify what kind of dangers i think
ooh okay
i just searched it and basically only know the toxic and fire ones
i forget all the dangers but i know i got tested on them for whatever reason
i think the point is, be careful
thats interesting that school taught you that
did you all also have to do those lab safety tests?
thats interesting that school taught you that
rip my wifi for a bit lol
well it might have been just my teacher since he was a retired industrial chemist or smth
uhhh like the tests asking awhat to do with different lab equipment?
well it might have been just my teacher since he was a retired industrial chemist or smth
ah okok
yeah!!! that stuff and the rules for being in a lab
ngl i failed mine once
hmm i think we had a quiz in the begining of the chem class but i think after that, he just assumed we knew
oh rippp
yeah apparently sometimes my common sense goes to sleep
F in the chat for that
fr fr
i cant recall if ap chem had a few questions about equopment and how to use stuff
lol thats a mood
its like how the permit test is common sense
oh i failed that the first time too ahahah
but i took sooo many practice ones and failed too many in the beginning lmao
shoot i forgot to keep practicing that oops
i passed the second time
but i think it was only because my parents kept drilling it into my brain ngl
like we were in sf and my dad was grilling me on parallel parking on a hillside
i havent gotten my permit because i just never felt like going to the dmv ahahaha
ew like the rules about which way to turn your wheels ?
yeah!! those
and then my brother kept laughing at me for forgetting the difference between high beam and low beam
sometimes i overthink it and go for the opposite of my instinct because thats how i used to get it right but then it fails LOL
omg i used to think that high beam was the best for everything before i took any practices
forgot that you need to be able to see and let others see 😩
lmfao
same though
okay now a really random question
what's everyone's favorite ice cream flavor
i cant decide uhh coffee or green tea or mint choco chip!
also i gtg eat now rip ttyl
omg mint chocolate chip! same
also i gtg eat now rip ttyl
so, uh, does everyone else just not eat ice cream?
my wifi is not it right now
awwww see you later!!! :3
mint chip or coffee!!!
oooh those are nice
loooll hiii! i never really talked in here haha
it's all good!!! how has your day been?
mm it’s been okk. it’s hot and lab was a little frustrating LOL
wbu???
awwww that's unfortunate. lab 3 or 4?
ah also i was planning out my schedule so that was a whole other stressful process T_T
lab 3 !
my day's been p good except for the part where i added a bunch more writing projects that i got to finish before september which was an oops

a lot of the discord bots are migrating over to slash commands as well
yeaa those r fun

┬─┬ ノ( ゜-゜ノ)

what's everyone's favorite season of the year?
fall is very nice in sd

I like the summer because of the daylight

Hey aerin

yeaaa i like the cold lol but also like,, the winter vibezzzzz
the winter sunsets tho
christmas is there too
Pretty good
omg yeah they're really pretty
bro beach in the winter
that's good! :3
i just like layering
lydiaaaa do you like snow?
yES
ahahahahahah
summer daylight is the best - i love the sunsets in the winter but it sets at like 5:30 sometimes >:((
Yeah
what's your favorite thing to do in the snow, lydia?
valid sort of, but the waters still cold in sd during winter
ahh true
I like the cold weather in winter
But the days are just too short
i just like stepping in fresh snow. it’s so weird. like if there’s a field of snow i just wanna run through it ahahahhah
True
yeaaa i like that lolol
fresh snow is so niceee but ski boots smh
oh bruh i hate the heavy boots
that’s one thing i canntt
do you do any snow sports?
i can ski but it’s been a couple of years since i went again
ahhhhh sameee
the last time i skied i fell over and i got yeeted out of them
-0-
Ski boots are so heavy
it was sad but kinda funny
well i'm glad you're alright now
lool yeee
i remember learning to ski, snowboard, and ice skate
yea i can barely walk in them
ooo
ice skatinggggg
yeah i started with ice skating and fell on my butt so often that i quit
i tried snowboarding but it’s so hard.. i never got it down
oh nooo ahhsjn
sameeee
i just ended up tumbling and falling on my butt ahahah
omg loooll samee
see i did snowboarding cause i thought skiing was too hard
as it turns out, skiing was easier on my butt ahahahahahah
omg LOL
i swear it's so easy to fall over in skii boots because they really lock your ankles in ahahah
I agree
skii boots are really unforgiving smh
the snowboarding boots are much nicer
Never snowboarded
once i skiied into a hula hoop and i got a giant bruise from my skii boot
i mean i was moving kinda fast, but it was like my whole shin
That sounds super painful
it wasn't though
i don't get how i got a bruise when all that happened was a light thump sound
Maybe a blood vessel got hit
trueeee
o wow
what kind of hobbies do y'all have
heuuu
mmm,, i used to journal which i want to pick up again but these days ig i play guitar and some games here and there
i want to start reading consistently but that never works out loool
wbu?? what do u like to do :DDD
Play the cello, but got lazy recently
ooo coollll
did u go out in competitions and all ??
Use too
mmm niceeee
i always wanted to try a string instrument but i was always just in band with the flute aha
Nice
i mean i write a lot, read a lot, learn a lot of random facts to fill the silence :3, talk way too much which is a more recent development, watch streams, and otherwise fill my time with something
but i haven’t played my flute in 2 years 💀💀
I tried saxaphone but couldn't get into the groove
omg stringed instruments are harddddddd
i've done guitar and violin and it's hard
ooo omg i relate to becoming more talkative
yooo sax is so cool
i joined a server with an activity req and went crazy within three days
yeaa i remember trying out my friends violin and i literally just made squeaking noises then gave up
omg loooll
i'm like ranked 8th even though it's been less than a month, granted it's a small-ish server
yea i became a lot more talkative after joining a discord server with school ppl
oo
dang
i'm not v active in the c'o 2025 one lmao
How many servers are you in?
me?
Yeah
gimme a sec i gotta count
K 😄
36 if we count this one
Wow
That's a lot
but if we subtract the two i've been using to play with bots that i own, then 34
I only have this server
although i might have miscounted ngl
but i think it's accurate
i mean, that could be a good thing
Nice
That means you have a lot of friends
i have to stay on do not disturb because otherwise my discord notifs would be going off a lot
ahahah not really, a lot of the servers i'm in are big ones either for games or scans teams or just fandom servers
and some of them are old and kinda dead
Oh
i only really frequent this one and the guild server i have for a game where i have an activity req
ahh sameee idk how to start talking in there lool
damn this server is popping off 24/7 now
honestly it was so active during the first few weeks and then died
LOL
Lol
ah icic
probably my fault, i'm really chatty
naw it’s good
ur keeeping it alive
ahahahah
I need people to talk to lol
i'm what you call  a chatty introvert
omg HAHA
yesss def relate
but i just passed the point of no return a week ago so i might be more of an ambivert now
lmfao
what happend a week ago
about a week ago i joined a guild for a game with an activity requirement
wowie
That's commitment right there
got panicked about the fact i'd have to talk and hit the requirement and then by the time i realized i was alright, i was already attached and had sent about a thousand messages
wha
LOL
what
i mean i type pretty fast and i also have had a lot of practice
do u post ur writing projects online
yes
bc i wanna read some LOOOLL
and i procrastinate on essays
sooo
oo i procrastinate on everything
you do writing?
yeah
:0000
what kind?
it's the only subject i can do minimal effort for
What
Writing takes the most time for me
naturally talented writer, can't relate 😢
i write in short bursts lol
i mean i do creative writing outside of school, but besides that i'm stuck proofreading whatever my family says i have to and doing schoolwork
Same
and it takes like a week out of my life
i don't understand how i write myself
writing takes practice T_T
i just sit down and start writing what i'm thinking
ahh
and then if it's for school, i jam in the quotes intermittently
oooh i do creative writing too
well, did
that's so cool!!!!
i used to
im in my school's literary magazine
but senioritis
oh that's super cool!
oo wow
omg senioritis was the reason i was averaging 3k words in my ao3
my brain was like "why do the dracula essay when you could just write something entirely unrelated"
bruh i find it so hard to get over 4k
omg LOL
yessss
i have no idea how many words i average
i used to struggle but now it feels too short if i write less than a thousand words
yea for sure
i get really bothered sometimes when i'm typing on discord and i hit the character limit but i'm not done with my thought
U HIT THE CHAR LIMIT ON DISCORD
whaT
lots of times
isn’t it like 2000
wot the heckkk
i don't know
omy goodness
i only hit it when i was spamming my friend
💀💀
oh i spammed my friend once , i gave them 100+ notifs in an hour
omg LOL
i was in spanish with nothing to do
holy shit
Imagine his phone ringing in class lol
in this other gc my friend and i talk so much that we blow up the other girls phone to 1000+ msgs every once in a while
nah my friend has their phone on silent mode lmfao
omg loooll
i swear none of my friends feel lonely cause i'm so chatty smh
dang
that’s pretty insane
yeah *now* that i think about it, it is
that is absolutely wild
LOL
ahaha she gets so pressed LOLLL
my social anxiety caps me off at three unresponded-to messages max 😎
oop
me when i check back the gg gc after i going to the bathroom: 72 new notifs
okay same, but only when i don't know the other person really well and their reply habits
the friend i gifted with 100+ notifs has a really bad habit of forgetting to respond so i just kinda just do whatever pleases me  ahahah
yea i just have really negative experiences relating to sending unresponded messages
lmaooo if you ever send me messages, promise i will reply lmfao
i have wayyyy too much free time
and even when i don't, i make it happen ahahahah
same, i can't stand to leave messages unreplied
honestly it just sits in my mind bugging me if i haven't replied
mhm
so i try to get replies done before i entirely forget
i can only kind of understand people who see they get messages but then forget to reply
okay but my parents leave me on read all the time
and so does my grandma
i'll text my grandma happy birthday or something and for days there will be nothing and then maybe a week later, there's a read thing on line
samee i will usually respond pretty quickly bc of that
omg loooll
when ur grandma leaves u on read 💔
i feel that ;-;
yeah and then she'll text me back much later in chinese even though she knows i can't read it
so i have to run it through google translate so google reads it to me
cause i can understand chinese but it's been years since i actually read chinese
omg HAHA
that’s so cute
i wanna learn chinese but ik ppl say it’s pretty hard -0-
idk it really depends
for one thing, if you have family who speak it, it's not that hard
and if you speak and asian language, it might actually be easier
i learned how to say “where’s the restroom” but my pronunciation is questionable
mmm that’s true
like i don't really understand much japanese, but i've been watching a show and i can recognize some chinese characters and i've picked up a few phrases
tv shows definitely help, though there are so many shows with different dialects and from different countries that speak chinese
ce suo zai na
ahahahah it took me a while to recognize what the pinyin said lmfao
my chinese-reading skills are
absolutely atrocious
you would think I didn't take like 10 years of chinese school 💀
honestly i just don't remember most of the characters i learned before i quit in 6th grade
yES
i used to go to tzu chi i think and omg it sucked
omfg i went to tzu chi too
those fucking white sweaters
i probably speak taiwanese hokkien better than i do chinese
that stupid uniform
and those nasty navy pants
i dont think i had to wear the pants, thank god
i remember how the teachers all wore literally the same thing
and i used to cause so much troubleeee
i was such a good student 👼
that was a joke
lmfaoooo
i learned absolutely nothing
honestly the only thing i learned was that the class was boring
oh and the rewards they gave out sucked
true
i went to chinese school for like 8 years and i cannot speak 💀💀
the only thing i can do is speak
i can kind of speak
write a bit
all my relatives speak full on chinese and when my mom yells at me, you bet she's screaming in chinese
i can’t write or read either 💅
and read some basic chinese
i guess taking ap chinese helped a litttttle
ahahahah ap chinese
my brother's going to take that sometime
i did spanish for my foreign language
i thought it was easier cause i'm much better with my latin roots
perhaps i should have done that
perhaps, but i messed up when i didn't take ap spanish :p
i had to take the foreign lang placement but idk if i did okay 
ooof
i mean it'll probably be quite easy but yeah, sucks
i took 3 years of it to retake it potentially lmfao
wait ethan, can you speak taiwanese?
no lmao
only think i know how to say is "you are a fat pig"
lmfaoooooo
whatever i've learned is from my older relatives speaking in taiwanese to gossip b/c some of my family can't speak taiwanese 
LMAO
issa struggle 😔
fr relatives are, they always think you understand more than you actually do
hi again jenny!!!
i would type the taiwanese i know but i dont know how to translate to pinyin :')
hellooo!
just read through everything hehe
omg taiwanese is so hard to do pinyin for
i think there are more intonations or smth for it
it reminds me of when people pinyin cantonese and i cant even possibly translate it
yeahhhh
i tried googling it and i gave up
i think the only perk of taiwanese is that other forms of hokkien are kinda similar to some degree
well that and if half of your family isn't able to understand it, gossip
mhm when i first found out that it was kinda the same as hokkien, i was shook
:((((
im the one they talk about
ahahah my family mainly speaks taiwanese but my mom's brothers both married ppl who can't so their kids don't
so my grandpa is always telling me to call him yeye idk if that pinyin is right
even though i call him ah-gong which is taiwanese
they just never felt like teaching us
ohh
wait i say both i never realized
oof i picked it up cause i was the only kid when i was born
my mom's side lived like in the area so they'd speak in taiwanese
i only learned that when i started going to chinese school and i told my teacher i liked my ah-mah and she was like wHaT?
ah makes sense, i cant pick up languages from hearing them easily because i just never understand it at all
oh LOL
i also always forget the different names for every relative depending on their relation to you
so i avoid mentioning anything but mama baba
omg i find it so frustrating when i have to explain who someone is relation to me in english
like my grandma's sister is my grandaunt in chinese but in english she's just my aunt or something???
it's really weird
huh isnt that grandaunt?? i just dont kunderstand the removed cousin stuff
honestly don't know, apparently all the forms don't allow for that?
that is so strange
right?
im glad i dont have to explain my relations LOL
i always forget who my cousins are and who my aunts/uncles are bc half of them are 40+ :')
oh wow
yeah both my parents are the youngest and they have large age gaps
and they had me late
so it added up
ohhh that's kinda wild
i don't know my cousins on my dad's side too well ngl
oh and i mean large age gap with their siblings not each other ahaha
not that i know any of my cousins too well lmfao
samee i think most are in taiwan so i rarely see them anyawys
lmaooo i guessed it was that :3
and yeah!!! it's so hard to see family when they're in a diff country
nice you can understand my uhhh bad talking skills LOL
right!! esp since i was supposed to go last summer or this summer
but nope
c ov id
okay but did covid wreck anyone else's travel plan?
ugh i was also supposed to go to new zealand
very bummed bout that
omg new zealand!!! that's where the hobbit set is!!!!
oo didnt know that! never watched it hehe
but yeah i also know someone there so it woudlve been so cool if i couldve met her (probably not tho)
lmaooo they made that set in like the 2000s
that's actually pretty cool!!
:o yeah i dont know much about movies since i literally never watched anything in the past
i should really see the classics
i think my parents let me watch lord of the rings
i got hooked, read the books, and then ended up watching the hobbit trilogy when it came out
honestly the battle of five armies makes people cry
so there's a warning :3
oh now i wanna see if i cry lol i used to never cry but sometimes the strangest things in movies will just break me
honestly i remember crying over raya
i think i always planned on reading lord of the rings but also never got around to that
ahahah
did you ever read eragon?
oh is that the new disney movie?
hmm
yeah it was one of the newer ones!!!
i think ive only seen the eragon summary but the book cover looks very familiar
oh that's actually really fair
the series is *long*
in terms of page count
oh thats something else i wanted to watch lmao i saw it on the plane but there wasnt enough time to finish it
the movie was different from the book, idr by how much
i think if i saw it in middle school i wouldve read it all because i literally read 24/7 ahahaha
soo many movies and books are really different
okay this begs a very important question (i really hope other people answer too) 
artemis fowl will make you question what the heck disney is doing
what the heck i didnt know there was even a movie made for that but i just googled it and all the auto questions are like "why is artemis fowl so bad" lmaoo
why can i literally not think of any right now even though i know a few exist!
im planning on watching the notebook with friends this week tho so we'll see how that goes
y es
i don't think i ever watched it
but definitely, if it's good, say so
are most people only here for open lab hours?
is that why it's just you & me in chat?
doesnt everyone love it though?
idk :(((
maybe we should temp move to dms until someone else joins lmfao
anyone else who comes, tell us about your crying movie experiences :D
y e s
dude endgame made me a mess lol
hi  again alexxxxxxx!!!
omg endgame made me so sad too!!!
heyyy and bro the amount of times i cried was crazy
ahhh that movie was a difficult one to watchhh
like i cried when black widow fell and then i stopped and then when everybody came i cried again and didn’t stop until the ending of the end credits😭😭😭
oh i heard a lot about endgame but i didnt want to watch the rest of the marvel series to watch it so i never did 😭
honestly i just c r y
jenny, i felt the whole wanting to watch the whole series
but my dad and brother kinda watched it without me  so i just kinda joined at random
the only marvel series i watched was the harley quinn stuff
wait isn’t that dc lol
harley quinn?
idk i think marvel produced 2 harley films?
oh wait fr
cause the new one that just came out is a dc film
i think so? when i went to six flags it was with the dc rides so thats the only reason i know
oh
i didn’t know that LMAO
yeah idk what was going on with that
thats strange but i guess i didnt know the difference for the longest time anyways so i wouldnt have realized lmaoo
cause some people i knew were chatting about the new suicide squad and saying it was funny that dc took the marvel director and marvel harley lmfao
oh yeahhh
wasn’t it joss whedon or sum i dont remember
oh wait its the new movies in theaters now right?
honestly i don't remember
yeah i think the new one is in theatres
bet
don't mind me and my weird spelling idk what happens but sometimes i switch between american spelling and british or something
nah you’re all good
i feel like people say theatre so much that i dont notice
theyre the same word to me lmao
lmaooooo
unlike color and colour
flavour and flavor
neighbourhood and neighborhood
lmao i don’t really notice the difference
the u sneaks in so often because i think during my troye phase he spelled neighbourhood with the u
mood asf
the ou's stand out more to me but it isnt a mentionable difference lol
ahahahah
honestly i just kinda go with my gut for spelling but i've also had plenty of correctly spelled words that i thought i misspelled
no cus same my gut is right hella
lmaooo
i check google too much when i spell words that i literally know how to spell
also not me having two different characters with one as my lock and one as my home screen
i swear piece trips me up so much
i need to just trust my spelling uhhhh its not like i dont make typos every other line anyways
omg yeah
peice
i type way too fast sometimes
so my words get messed up lol
im too lazy to change my lock/home screens hehe
same
omg i type to fast and sometimes my keyboard can't keep up
sometimes every word i type is red underlined and i just trust that people can read it anwyas
my lock and homescreen be my bf and i lmao
it’s pretty much the same
awwwwwwwww that's so cuteeeee
yeah cutee!
yessir‼️‼️
autocorrect does me so dirty sometimes that i just turn it off and type whatever the heck i want
i think mine is off cus sometimes i type slang and it’s like ????
i hate that thing but sometimes i completly have my fingers off by one and those corrections are useful
it'll autocorrect all the romaji i type and it just kinda goes downhill from there
fr fr
also do you all have that weird thing where your phone recs you german or some european language despite your keyboard and your phone being in english?
what no haha
i’ve never seen that happen
oh yeah when i type pinyin i just have a habit of clicking the middle button after each word even it it wasnt gonna be corrected
hmmm nope
ive only had chinese ads LOL
LMAOOO
my phone and ads think i'm google translate or something
I had italian ads for a bit on ig😭
my phone is like you must speak some random european language that you don't
and then i keep getting men's ads and ads in spanish
lmaoooo
español
i used chinese google translate so much that my phone would give me a RECOMMENDATION every day to go on the app (like when they recommend you to set an alarm or open maps for somewhere you go a lot sfsfsfisjfk)
pretty much i just sit there barely comprehending what's going on
wow your phone must be bad at catering to you, their loss!
ahahah my phone recommends me two of my games
marketing really missed the target with me lmfao
bro sometimes i wonder how the alg for that works fr
i will say youtube screwed up theirs
cus like sometimes it’s mad accurate and other times it’s questionable
i keep getting recommended stuff that i have never seen before
and their ads are all off
i just hate when i talk about smth and get an ad for it on insta litearlly a minute later
i can't count how many times i've gotten the same old spice ad
lmaooo i've never seen that
can we talk abt that like that genuinely freaks me out
lol i have adblock on youtube so i wouldnt know what i get anymore
when i run out of posts from friends i just get cat pics
IT DOES
and the same w/ snap sometimes
like
ill take a pic of pizza
and open a friend's story
and boom a pizza ad
omg i want to disable snap's reels and stories
FR
their recs for stories are just kinda weird and really clickbait-y
and a number of them are gross
oh i only click friend stories not the actual snap stuff
fr it’s scary
i just dislike seeing the recommendations cause they have no taste
my first discover thing is "loren and her bf are relationship goals 😍 "
like at least instagram knows what i like lmfao
LMAOOO NO
yeah
litearlly idc 😩
o yes one of my instas has pet vids :D apparently because my friend dmed me a lot
omg wait i love that
could literally scroll for hours theyre so adorable
pets are too cute fr
we need more pet pic pics!
i need to be blessed with them
knowing that someone i kinda know owns the pet irl makes it so much better than just google
fr fr
like it’s irl!
honestly i just have old ones
and wait
insta knows me too well
my ig alg is too good
they recommended a reel of a cat crossing a basketball court
aww
yesss
i also only have old ones ahhh im so sad i doubt ill see the cats again :(
i have a bunch of cats in my neigborhood
there's a whole family that lives on my block
jealous.
there’s a cat that comes in my backyard sometimes
and then there are a bunch that i just see on occasion
omg that is so cuteeee
i wanna see if i have the video
ooo outdoor wandering cats are kinda like having a pet but not the responsibility
excuse my voice LMAO
that's so cute
wait the fur pattern is so cool too
honestly i hope there are just cats wandering on campus
idk whose cat it is but it comes every so often
sameee
i wanted to ask my friend if she saw any but she wasnt even on campus last year </3

@John._. will you do Karaoke with me?
We can sing duets
There are technically no pets allowed on campus, but sometimes people have support animals, and last year in muir there were a few cats that needed houses so they could stay
ok spis reunion convoy karaoke night
I can bring the machine!
ohhh will that be our spis meetup too omg
Can we also make SPIS pizza
yes
spis-y pizza! just like the bops

oh i wonder how the regulations will be mm
👀 👀
@John._. I love and appreciate you! ❤️
brooo i went to walmart today and they were selling waffle makers for $8
did you buy one
as well as sandwich and pancake machines
no unfortunately but i’ll probably get one later
okay but waffle makers are useful
i think you can make pancakes without a machine
you could prob get one for when you move out of dorms (if youre dorming)
yeah you can it’s just idk abt using a stove in the dorm
it’s a small one makes a single tiny one
Waffles > Pancakes
yesss
Waffle gang
eggo waffles
I have a question
i just wanna bring a hot water boiler
hi timothy :3
waffle supremacy
hiii!
hi
Can we make a like
Professor appreciation thing
Like that could be cool
we couldddd
ooh frfr
oo yes
Cause I feel like it’s hard to give them appreciation with just a thank you after lecture
fr
true
make a card
an e-card
mhm they just see a lot in the chat
Can we make a presentation with quotes and stuff
ohhh we could
bet
And we can do SPIS Karoake recordings over it?
as long as they get to keep it :3
oo start writing down iconic quotes if they say anytihng
it would be great
i remember doing this two summers ago, it was harddd
Actually @ferreti made a quote thing
Because she’s a queen coder
omg fr
woahh
Yeah like that website thing from the first facet
bruhhh
i had this writing thing and my mentor/teacher? would say the funniest and weirdest things so we tried to track it but it got hard after a few weeks
it might be easier online? not sure
we kept it on a doc
maybe yeah
but it was def hard to keep track of after a certain point
oh :(
maybe a google sheet
i found one of the things he said actually lmfao
"among"
?
?
ethannnnnn please explainnnnnn
on a less related note once the guy said “i don’t know all the rules of your residential prison”
LMAO
honestly looking at the doc where we kept the quotes we wrote for him brings back memories
i bet
that’s why we should do one for spis :3
just random quotes with no context
gary and his wine
lmfaoooo
i just found these and cracked up ngl
THE THIRD ONE PLEASE
write poetry after drinking soju
yeah that one came into existence because i said i wrote poetry in the middle of the night lmfao
that would probably give you great poems though
fr omg
I am not driving anymore
I guess we could do a spreadsheet
bet
sounds good
I bet 1 cent
if we’re gonna bet i’d rather bet hugs or something lmfao
1 cent and a hug
yes
Viable to change to high five
ahahahaha
Is this what gambling is
yes!
pretty sure😳
no clueeee lmfao
This reminds me Curt gave me some practice stack frame problems and turtle problems
I sent him this gif
i never played blackjack with bets
https://tenor.com/view/turtle-cute-animated-rolling-gif-17771418
And he laughed
turtle!!
So I feel very lucky
awwwww isn’t that carl?
from the carl bot?
Idk a Carl
i swear it’s the same turtle
idk lmfao
it’s cuteee
the turtle looks like a carl
Oki Doki
That reminds me

https://tenor.com/view/giraffe-eating-framesequence-framesequence-gifs-petter-pentila-gif-14382049
lmaoooo
i redrew the head cause it was disproportionate
so far
That’s pretty amazing!
This SPIS giraffe is spectacular
it’s finally done!!!
@Cinnamon Bun ^
Oh my gosh !!!
giraffe!!
It looks like a giraffe!
ahhhh i misssed coloring the mouth
lemme fix it
It’s freaking amazing
You add your signature too!
Near the head!!!
@ragdoll kitten

omy gosh
that's so good what the heck!!! and it was put together so well sjfefkerakj
wthhhh
spis is honored to have such an amazing giraffe
okay here’s the final one
i hope it looks okay ;w;
@Cinnamon Bun ^
@ragdoll kitten WHERE IS YOUR SIGNATURE
Add it !
it's there
I think it looks great
Why can’t I see it
it's under the mouth
Am I blind
MAKE IT BIGGER >:O
no
https://tenor.com/view/cute-cat-crying-tears-sad-emotional-gif-15881815
But
okay okay fine
don't cryyyyyyyy
I’m really tired
I cry when I’m tired XD
awwwwwwwwww
It’s okay I’m sorry for crying
I just want your name to be there
Cause we made art together
And you have to sign your art
It’s a rule
better?
nooooo don't be, it's okayyy :3
I’m going to steal your signature and make it even bigger, mark my words.
i-
why
Because it needs to be big
It’s the law
lmaoooo
i mean i think it's fine as is lmfao
so i guess i can draw non-squishy animals?
You can!
But it’s hard to draw animals
Especially horses
it really is
Idk why
so i guess our spis giraffe is done
i was about to say zebra even though i knew it wasn't a zebra i-
Zebra is the next animals for SPIS conquest?
omg noooo
This time you draw the body?… and I draw the head?
the pattern is harder
It’s like driver and navigator
We gotta switch
i thought we just agreed horses were hard zoeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
We did
pair programming for drawing <333
But driver and navigator
https://tenor.com/view/hyper-gif-18023825
then why are we drawing horses againnnnnn
i-
Sam gets it
draw frogs <3
y e s
frogs
zoe this gif
im dying
It’s me!
Can’t you see it?
lmaooo i can see it zoe
i bet there's someone here who can draw a horse better than me lmao
that is such a good gif
what gif?
also hi ethan :3
hi aerin :3
:3
just added a bunch of stuff i want from ikea to a cart
that sounds fun
ikea has cool stuff
it was
i love capitalism
lmaoooooooooooo
fun fact, i have never actually been to ikea
wHat?
i went to costco yesterday and bed bath and beyond today
buying stuff for your dorm room?
yep, its my secret weapon at "never have i ever"
mhm
omg lmaoooo
i used to have chick-fil-a as my secondary
but i had it a month ago and it was infuriatingly good
lmaoooooooooo
honestly i feel like i'd probably not be good at never have i ever
i've done a lot of pretty stupid things lmao
never have i ever is the best game for people with no life 😔
my brain just randomly went “cards against humanity”
idk what it means but i played it once and it was interesting
oml i just realized my brother starts school today ahahahahah
imagine starting school in august 🤮
cards against humanity is so much fun
i was so caught off guard b/c i didn't know what the cards were like
i mean it's high school?
ah yes they are
quite nsfw
yeah that made for an interesting few rounds where i was thoroughly confused
i didn't know the game was like apples to apples but adult ahahah
LMAO
it was an experience to say the least
totally random but i swear so many people play genshin
aha funny you mention that, i do too
oh you do? i died around twenty times in a row trying to complete the gliding permit's level 1 thing and then deleted the app lmfao
i mean everything else was fine except that it also managed to make my phone exceedingly feverish
i stuck to fgo after that
oh LMAO
yea genshin is brutal on all phones
some girl i knew wanted me to cosplay a character from it
i can only run it pretty well bc i have a pretty new phone
so i thought i'd check it out but yeah game was too hard :3
ooh which character
lemme look in my chats with a diff friend i think i found the name
but she has like pastel purple hair
keqing?
yeah! her
idk why her of all characters
she has a pretty easy to replicate design
main thing is the fake cat ears with hair
ohhhh
well i'm still not gonna do it lmao
LMAO
i've had the experience of wearing fake ears
they weren't cat ears, but fox ears
https://tenor.com/view/keqing-keqing-poke-electro-slime-immune-gif-20687653
and i also had a tail to match lmfao
this is she, for reference
is she just stabbing the slime?
with a finger, yes
wow
....what were you coslpaying
nothing it's been my halloween costume many times
it was once my brother's costume for his what does the fox say that practically all the kids his age did back when the song was big
once i passed it off as a kitsune costume
the rest of the time it was just a low effort costume for fun
i see
if you dont mind me asking, why the objection to cosplaying as her
i don't know her as a character + no clue what her voice lines are
it would be awkward if someone saw me and she was their fave character
oh and then i'd get worried that someone would ask me about the game ahahah
@Viridion ^ :3
oh LMAO
yea thats reasonable
genshin is fun, but its also a lot
so i've heardddd
do you have a favorite character?
i find paimon absolutely irritating
zhongli
https://tenor.com/view/zhongli-gif-19298968
oh wow he looks cool
Yes
As of right now, you also cannot get him anymore
ohhhh that's interesting
i feel like he's one of those popular characters who has a bunch of fanfics
So the exclusivity adds to the allure
i know kaeya's also popular
He is, in fact
ohhhh that's v true
i have some friends who like to whale on games
A couple of my friends simp for kaeya
wow lmao
ngl i thought kaeya was a girl for a while
https://tenor.com/view/kaeya-my-beloved-kaeya-kaeya-genshin-genshin-impact-kaeya-genshin-impact-gif-20028977
lmfao
Of all the characters in Genshin, him???
Although the chest window probably added to it
kaeya seemed like one of those noveau ways of spelling kaya
Ok I can kinda see how you make that mistake
i thought maybe he was just flat???
LMAO
Ok I have to shower brb
okay :3
hmmm should i do an appearance change and wear glasses tomorrow?
Go for it
lmaooo guess i will then
i have a nice frame so it'll be fun
ahahah it can be one of those spot the difference games lmfao
unrelated but riot games really has life figured out
they started doing music and apparently now they're doing a show too?
meanwhile blizzard wow animatics are so nice
but they don't turn them into like actual movies
my 1 am complaints are weird as heck
Didn’t the wow movie suck balls
yeah apparently
but ngl cgi is not their strong suit imo
it's actually their trailers for the games that rock
Mhm
like the shadowlands patch for wow had some seriously great art and storytelling and voice acting
i think the game with the best cgi trailer i've seen would be the one made for diablo 4
Ah I wouldn’t nnow, never touched wow before
i don't play either game
i ended up getting into the rabbithole of wow lore after i accidentally came across one of the videos
my dad played wow ages ago and he still plays diablo
I remember watching and rewatching some of the old Star Wars game trailers
Those were cool
I did the same for league lmao
oml league
i think i only got interested b/c of k/da + the lead singer for this band that i liked did a song with them
and then someone showed me that they somehow made a holographic dragon appear in a stadium which i thought was cool
Damn that’s wild
but i had an ex who played league
Red flag 🚩
ahahahahahah
what makes that a red flag?
Joking, it’s just fun to dunk on league
oml lmfao
I’ve never actually tried it myself
my brother did and he complained about it
i don't remember what his complaint was
Everyone I know who plays or has played league hates it
wait then why do they still play?
It’s bizarre to me
Exactly!
okay but i kinda understand that sentiment
sometimes i really hate the games i play because i have to do so many events in a month
i guess it takes a real league player to explain how one can hate a game and still play it lmfao
I just don’t play games if I feel like it’s become a responsibility instead of for fun
lmaoooo i should do that
but it's hard to not play them ahsfklhsaf
Yea
The way I like to think of It is
If I’m playing just so I don’t fall behind on progression or advancement of some kind
And I don’t actually enjoy the process of playing it
Then I’m not going to enjoy it later on when I’ve achieved whatever I’m currently doing in the game
Bc there will always be more things to do
ohhhhhhh
that makes sense
that just described animal crossing pocket camp
LMAOOO
every month there's a new event with three parts
and every month i play it even though it's like a job
that is so sad
i tell myself i don't need every single stupid pixel furniture
Toxic relationship 😤
but then i come up with another reason to play
although a lot of my old friends stopped playing :3
Ahh
That was the case for me and Genshin for a while
I initially started playing bc all my friends were
But about two months after I started really getting into it, they lost interest
So I didn’t really know anyone playing for a few months
ohhh well all my friends were mainly adults who had lives outside of the game lmao
But I still enjoyed the game so I kept it up
And over the past few months, I got my other friends into it, so now I have even more reason to continue playing
Ahhh that makes sense
No sense in keeping up a job by playing a game when you have to keep up a job irl
lmfao yep
i honestly ask myself why i still stay up late sometimes
That revenge sleep procrastination or smth
lmfao
“Revenge bedtime procrastination” describes the decision to sacrifice sleep for leisure time that is driven by a daily schedule lacking in free time.
out of curiosity, how is it that you never sleep much?
You know, I’m not quite sure
I think I average 6 hours?
I just like the vibes at night I guess
that's fair
Also I have piss-poor time management
oml sameeee
But it’s ok!
I still (mostly) function day-to-day
i-
It’s a skill developed over time
that's scary
yikes
I’ve been trying to at least get 7 hours per day the past few weeks
Not working out too well for the most part
yikes bro
https://tenor.com/view/capoo-bugcat-capoo-bugcat-sweating-dannielteo-gif-16864462
@diegom1
honestly sometimes i use brute force to fix my sleep schedule
how does that work
melatonin gummies?
you get up REALLY early when you sleep late so that at the night you'll be so tired you have no choice but to fall asleep
20 year old entrepreneur schedule: get up at 4 am and do pushups
sigma grindset
how are you this quick sam
amazes me fr
as alex h said, melatonin
yessir iktr
ah
never tried it before
it works lemme tell you that
it works but if you overtake them they won't
bro they make u feel like heavy if you overtake
and then you'll have to hunt for the stronger alternative that i think is much harder to find
i have never taken more than 1 ngl
the one i take is two
but i know an insomniac who kept upping their dosage and now the melatonin does nothing
:0
that sounds painful
dang fr
happened to some of my friends
not even helping ;-;
torture fr
honestly i think the only other brute force method is to make yourself tired by aggressively messing up your sleep schedule
i did that once and actually went to bed on time for the first time
that's what i did once
idk it didn't work for me HAHA
John has provided us with artwork, unintentionally, with funky wifi
LOL
It's like super cool looking
I like it
Beatiful painting with the added figure: John
lmaoooooo zoe
for whatever reason it feels like everyone and everything is so tall lmao
fr fr
john is actually 6 ft tall
lindsey like 5'10
ohhhh wow
@Cinnamon Bun i forgot to ask this last night, what are we naming the giraffe?
joe
w h y
does the name joe have some kind of significance lmao
Joe mama
lmfao
but it's a giraffeeeeeee
Also I really said guys after telling everyone to say everyone
Fml
TWICE
I'm trying 😔
as my high school art teacher said, "a for effort"
so i remember mentioning that i took a language placement test for spanish after i stopped studying it for two years
i guessed on quite a bit on it too i-
Do not worry Diego, mistakes happen! Don’t be sad.
I like saying Y’all just imagine you’re a cowboy
We can all wear cowboy hats like Curt and be super epic
Then you’re obligated to say y’all
zoeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
hi
Also I think a lot of people say “you guys” as a gender inclusive thing. Like: dudes or hey dude. But maybe not? So it’s a bit hard sometimes to switch from what you’re used to.
AERIIIIIIIIIIN
Hello
what are we naming the giraffe and are we taking suggestions
I came back form my voice lesson, she told me I have to spin more
Hmmm
what's spin mean?
Like a tornado
Spin
The air has to spin in a column
ohhhhhhh
https://tenor.com/view/twister-tornado-disaster-storm-cyclone-gif-14469565
Like this
Make the air spin
lmaooooo
that's kinda cool
oh goodness i just realized the memory book channel now has pictures of me with my glasses ahahah
XD
No one has a picture of me in my glasses except maybe Sam here?
I mean, I have opera, in the meme room.
i think i've seen you with your glasses in a zoom session though
So like, nothings truly wonky
I don’t wear them in front of my computer, so probably not
Sorry to say
lmfao
https://tenor.com/view/dog-dawg-eoq-wut-wtf-gif-9118700
You^
yeah
i might just be really sleep deprived and confused then
Ha ha
i keep forgetting how much work glasses are ngl
i usually wear contacts
Glasses plus masks
aw shucks i don't think anyone else i know is online besides you zoe ;w;
https://tenor.com/view/anime-waiting-for-text-waiting-for-your-reply-gif-14108959
omg i heard they fog up so bad
I’m always online.
ahahahah
but same
It’s true… even at night
I don’t turn discord off
yeah it's because i stayed up that i have to wear glasses now :3
Ha ha
I’m just blind
omg no same
but i've been wearing nighttime contacts for a long time
I’m allergic to contacts
They messed up my eyes
so usually i can see fine without glasses, i just skipped wearing them last night so i got to wear my glasses
ohhhhhh
my dad can't wear them either
i don't mind wearing my glasses though, i picked a nice frame this time lmao
My group and Diegos group and Michael’s group all learned I’m sensitive to the COVID vaccine today too
Allergies are crazy
they really are
Bees
Also crazy
lmaooo yes
What else is crazy
how limited the amount of food i can eat is?
i don't have actual restrictions on what i eat, just self imposed stuff
I don’t have enough context
To say whether or not that’s crazy
oh for example, i don't like bell peppers because they have this smell that i hate
https://tenor.com/view/umm-confused-blinking-okay-white-guy-blinking-gif-7513882
You don’t even like green bell peppers?
That’s pretty crazy
and then i don't like most smoothies because my mom has made really thick smoothies and i don't trust smoothies that aren't pink or purple-y
yeah i don't like bell peppers, refuse to eat most forms of garlic and onions, and almost never eat spicy food
i'm just odd
told you it was crazy :3
It was!
Sorry I took a shower
lmfao dw :3
@lyd hi lydia!! how has your day been?
how has your day been?
hi aerin!! my days been good :)) i went outside for once lolol

lmao i've been having a good day! it's been fun socializing!!! honestly never thought i'd say the second part lmao
hi jennyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
yay that’s great :D also nice glasses lol are you planning on wearing night contacts at school?
no clue ahahah
hiiiii i just woke up from another nap lmao
ohhh that's niceeee
how has your day been?
also i want to wear night contacts at school but that depends on how much sleep i average lmfao, i can't wear em if i sleep less than 7 hours
it’s been alright but i’ve been so groggy and i still am
oh yeah night contacts are annoying for that lol i feel like so many college students have messed up sleep so some stop wearing it
wait jenny do you also wear them???
it also is kinda a hassle in semi public bathrooms
uhh i wear one
only my left LOL
ohhhh
but yeah fr it's a hassle to do contacts, much less in public bathrooms
i feel like my eye will die one day because i always get lazy when it comes to keeping it hygienic too
also if anyone's lurking in the chat, please join ussssssssss i wanna try to get to know everyone in spisssss ;w;
i k r
omg pls be careful though
oh no what happened?
i honestly don't know, i just had a hard time taking them out one day and then i managed to injure my right eye :3
that's why you gotta be careful cause if it happens too many times/a lot of damage happens no more night time contacts
i’m also just not sure if their guidelines are just to get money from us because one of my friends has a lot more lenient optometrist and apparently he says everything is still fine with his contacts and eyes
ohhh yeah
sometimes it kinda gets stuck on your eye and it hurts so bad to take it out then, but i usually check to make sure it’s loosened or else i’ll use eye drops first
yeah it really gets difficult
i can't imagine how cosplay contacts feel, esp sclera ones
also @Viridion hi!!!! how has your day been?
o m g i had to search that up the all black looks so creepy
i don't know how people do those contacts cause i swear it's hard plastic in your eye
literally... looking at those images makes me cringe in pain already lmao
lmao felt that
sighs my mom says i gotta eat because i’ve been sleeping too much 😭 that isn’t even a valid reason to tell me go eat but- lmaoo
lmaooo have funnnnnnnn :3
ttyl :D also always feel free to ping of something if you’re boreddd and *perhaps* you’ll be able to summon me ahahah
ahahah okay :3
i feel like most people are busy rn, though i don't know why
My day was good! I was happy we got a tour and got to see mentors. I liked meeting other groups and confusing people with singing then having an opera voice lesson.
Socializing is 10/10 favorite
y e s ss
i hope more people slowly start to get active here in the chat :3
I think they’re shy
i want more friends to chat with ahahah
I agree
I feel like it’s mostly the girls hanging out and chatting
I could be wrong though
yeah mostly girls
so far i think i've seen a handful of guys drop by but not many
i swear this chat doesn't bite and i can make a bunch of puns related to cats and animals on purpose if that sets anyone at ease lmfao
You know what I want to code?
A like UCSD map app kinda like Disneyland
oml that would be so helpful!!!!!!!!!!
A nice cute thing where you can sort by like bathroom or gym or dining hall
It would track where you are you know and show you the fastest path
yes and it would be great if it could get updates on wherever construction is
Absolutely!
That’s what I wanna code
Idk how to
Should I ask a mentor XD
i think you'd need a few things
but otherwise it's pretty do-able
A map feature of some kind, a cute interface, and tracking as well as information…
yes
it would be like waze but ucsd only
if you look up “ucsd map” there’s something kind of like that on the ucsd site
i think you might need a data set or take data from google maps lmfao
not cute but it tries
https://maps.ucsd.edu/map/default.htm
LOL
omg that's cool
but also, i would still get lost with the map lmfao
need a live gps navigator
i wish it was an app
mannn ima get lost every single day
Aww
but honestly having a living breathing person is 100x better than a map
It’s nice but not cute enough
lmaoooo
sometimes i find myself forgetting my lefts and rights
I want something like this
Like you can filter it out by which park
You know where you are
It tells you information
ohhhhh that actually seems nicer and easier to use
i think that's all ux stuff then
Like the drop down window and stuff
But instead its like buildings or stuff
And like reviews maybe like Yelp on dining hall stuff
I know for sure the app needs the map, it should have a drop down window, windows for where each thing with words are, and a search button
Maybe it would also be beneficial to have notifications or something? So like a banner area to say: have a good day! Or good luck on finals! And then information like: there is construction!
there’s some ucsd apps and stuff but idk if the map is on there
Idk either
Research competition then make it better so ours is most popular
Then we have to make it more accessible for each different kind of user and we should create a business plan
https://tenor.com/view/anime-zero-two-cute-smile-nod-gif-13451534
I don’t know how to code much but I’ve done business plans and presentations for apps as well as did interface design
So we can definitely do it
i took a ux design class
Yay!
Ooh how cute would it be to design a little triton person on the front
lmaooo it could be cute
Hmmmmmmm
Maybe I can get some friends to design the triton person
Since I deem people too hard
ahahah people are indeed difficult
especially eyes
i've seen many wonkily drawn humanoid beings
I argue mouths are harder
hands and arms though
i've seen those go wrong so many times
I like drawing bones
So it’s easier
honestly just drawing is hard
Ignore the fact I don’t know how light works
I like bonesssss
So arms and hands aren’t too bad
that's cool
i like bones but not in that sense
I like bones a lot
i like the bones in human anatomy collections
Did you know in your head you have a bone called the butterfly bone
It’s soooo cool
lmaooo i did not
i learned the anatomical term which i also promptly forgot
https://tenor.com/view/hand-anatomy-movement-muscles-science-gif-20640966
but i still have my human anatomy coloring book
Oooh coloring books
I like to color
Colors are so nice
I have a friend who is colorblind who roasts me cause I play with colorblind mode on
I just like seeing the world differently sometimes
that last bit i felt
that's why i write and read fiction
i feel like fiction really gives you the snapshot into someone's mind
Books are great
ye s
did you read any good books recently???
Hmmmmm
I started reading These Feathered Flames.
It’s pretty okay so far
I have been a bit busy to be reading honestly
@ragdoll kitten your dinner looks yummy
ahahah lmao
oooh tell me if it's good, i need to get back into reading cause i'm bringing some books with me to campus
lmaooo it is :3
i technically know how to make it
um spis final project vibes owo
🤔
it does kinda sound like one ahahah
omg i just realized the giraffe is still nameless or do you normally not name the animals you draw?
their name is joe 😄
hi ethannnnnn
wassup
their name is joe :)
when did we decide the giraffe was male
who said anything about the giraffe being male
you and sam originally referred to the giraffe as him lmfao
i did no such thing
that's not what the edited thing next to your message says lmfao
i have no idea what you're talking about
ethan that sounds like something a toddler would say after eating all the cookies before dinner
yo don't bully ethan like this :(
hi sammmmmmmm
lmfao
🥺
lmao aerin be carrying this chat
hi adriannnnnn :3
so what up guys, what colleges yall from?
ayooo
anyone else from muir??
i'm from revelle! :3
seventh
okay i just realized that besides adrian, i only know one other person from muir that i can remember lmfao
loool i’m also from muir !!
omg lydiaaaaaaaaa hiiiiiiiiiiiiii
also adrian was just asking who was from muir!
yay i know three people!!! :3
i say just asking as if over 30 minutes haven't passed lmao
LOL hellooooo
omg ahahahahah
yea i barely know anyone from muir
kinda out of da loop
ahahahah honestly idk how many people i know from revelle
i've lost track of all the people who messaged me from diff group chats + instagram i-
omg
dang ur so social
i only msged my roommate LOL
i am not social actually
that was back when i was still kinda feeling awkward
oo
these people just randomly messaged me i-
LOL
yea sometimes random ppl follow me on insta and im just 0_0
btw do u have an insta :0
LOL
yes :3
lmao
and i gained like 300 followers after committing to ucsd, it was kinda terrifying
whoaaaaa
wots ur userame!?
angrycloudkitty
and ofc my username has something to do with cats lmfao
loooll thats fun
okie i requested aha
already approved it lmao & send a request back ahahah :3
LOL yessh
i didnt follow any ucsd ppl until spis sstarted -0-
i spent a lot of my summer just following people back
and getting messages
and answering them i-
x_X
man i would be so tired
honestly i blame myself for being like lemme post an intro!
omg LOLLLL
i was too shy to do that -0-
idk i feel so awk
ahahah i was quite impulsive and did it
and then i basked in regret as the messages came in and people thought i was interesting enough to message
omg HAHA
at least ppl wanted to get to know u LOLLL
i wasn't emotionally prepared for people to actually message me though ;w;
ahh yeaa
it's fine no one messages me anymore, even those weird scammy sugar parent accounts
omg LOOLL
SUGAR PARENT
well i had a a female person message me and i've had a male person message me too
so i figured parent was most inclusive
ahahah yess accurate
i think the most awkward convo i had was one where someone reached out to me about lore for middle earth despite only watching the movies
either way
i think it's more fun getting to know everyone here!
oo interesting
yeaaa its fun talking to new ppl no matter how introverted i am :DDDD
i wish more people who are online would talk h e r e
i swear i say this so often
LOL
frrrr tho
it would be so fun esp since its a smaller grp than,, the ucsd25 disc X_X
and i would like to get to know everyone in similar majors :)))
yeah omg that discord is huge and i just kinda don't have the energy to keep up with all those people
samee
i get kinda curious sometimes as to why people don't chat here more
i mean originally i didn't cause it was really really really dead lmfao
loooooll
yea i wonder why D:
maybe they just arent chatty ahahsdhs
or feel awk? that was originally y i was hesitant
that would make for an interesting question to pose
true
okay but i like to think that i'm capable of talking to almost anyone so long as there's a shared language
oh and i can't be anxious either
LOL yeaa btu sometimes idk what to say so im like ahh ima just dip
oo
Hello friends
but if both conditions are met, whatever people want to talk about at the very least, i'm willing to listen to hours upon hours of their interests
o hi ethan
hello ethannnnnnnnnn
mmm ic
That is a very admirable skill
i have very rant-y relatives so i can handle hours of stuff i don't understand or know much about
LOL getting that practice from family
it wasn't by choice tho
Well, most skills aren’t
~~i learned to sew because i wanted to~~
Ok, some
yikes my friends from a diff gc are telling me i'm not active enough oops
How active are you in that other gc usually??
oh it's half alive half dead
i apparently haven't been replying to messages
o
okay but lowkey is anyone else left handed here?
usually i can see people's handedness irl but can't really see that on zoom, same with height ngl lmfao
hi jennyyyyy
no but i used to think i wouldve been if i wasnt taught how to use my right first!
also warning: i took a melatonin to ensure i go to bed sometime early so i might disappear
that's so interesting!!
omg you always say hi when im typing how are you so quick 😩
yeahh i noticed that i used my left hand for some strange things that i cant even name
and in sports sometimes i was better when i used it lol my left arm is also stronger for a strange reason
i type a lot so i am very quick with my words
but- i didnt even send a message yet!
i learned how to use a mouse and draw with one using my right hand but i do practically everything else with my left hand
i mean i could see you were typing :3
you should get rest if you're tired :3 im sleepy as well because i was dumb last night ahahah
ohh i never thought about how mice(mouses??) would affect left handed ppl hmmm
true true
well i can't exactly use power tools without being extremely careful
:3
They make left handed and ambidextrous nice too right
Mice
they do but it's uncommon
i dont touch those my hands are sooo shaky
usually if you go out places, then you end up seeing the right handed mouse
i also learned to flip right handed scissors
Flip?
oh yeah i guess a lot of left handed people have to learn to use their right anways bc its so much more common
wait like take it apart or just hold it in a way that works better?
Oooh
I thought you meant throw it in the air
LOL
i definitely didnt think of it that way
i have to turn them the other way
like usually you hold them one way, i use them in the mirror of that
wait like with the pointy part towards you?
i'll just take a picture
usually people use it the other way
i mean that way
ugh my brain
i flip it
so you see
like the other side
hey guys
what if you did
ok i thnk i get it but i just tried imagining how i normally use scissors and its been so long that im confusing myself
a typing test
:)
hi sam :o
hi jenny :)
hi sammmmmmmmm
oh like the wpm wtuff?
https://monkeytype.com/
who me?
this is my favorite typing website
i have an average of about 60 wpm
:o
i used to use that but i forgot how it was
but you type so fast
i mean it fluctuates
idk i could check i still have the results i had to submit for a class i took
wait 60 sounds not right
youre speedy
speeeeeeeed
i think i reached 100+ multiple times on my old laptop
probably not this one tho
yoiks
oops
it was 65 wpm with a 98% accuracy
ooh nice
did u do the 30 second test?
it was the one minute test
i highly doubt i could do the 30 second test and have a decent accuracy
yeah im gonna try one min because im bound to mess up more if i have to type that long lol
LOL
i had to do one minute because my prof said so
it was for a transcription class
i just did and got 100 yayy
is this like an intense workout or smth tho
ooooh niceeeeeeeeeee
my heart rate is scarily high from TYPING
what's your wpm?
ooh transcription class?
o it was 100 wpm 99% accuracy lol i mistyped a few in a row at the end and had to keep backsapcing
yeah it was medical healthcare transcription, i originally took it to learn about chart notes cause i was curious
ohhh icic
:amogus:
did you like it?
youre cracked
it was pretty fun lmao sam types hella fast
yeah i dont think ive seen anyone faster
i know right?
i remember a few years ago friends would be bragging with less than 60 LOL
i have a friend that goes 160
she's very cracked
you guys are just built different
*people
i need to stop sayin guys too 😩
y'all
idk!!! i thought guys was a gender neutral ish term
like
i get that guy is male
but i've referred to so many people as guys
so i guess i gotta change that
yeahhh
and people bro/bruh a lot too
also used to be generally associated with males
honestly i've just given up and started going with y'all and everyone
Yea I always thought of “guys” as a gender neutral term as well
same but also some ppl have dysphoria
i had a y'all phase a while ago but i change my typing habits a lot
i honestly just go with whatever pops in my head first lmfao
yeah i should just set something as autocorrect on my phone as well in case lol
same same
I have gone from “guys” to “friends” to “besties” for the most part
y’all is the best
also some of my friends are like "girllllll" no matter the gender lmao
omg besties
besties <3
if i don't know what to do i usually just insert either a meow or something cat related
it's solved all my problems so far
meow
i don't see why it can't continue to :3
nya.
i havent seen that word in years
lmfao i think the most random thing i started saying recently is ara ara~
and that's because the bot that tells me i've leveled up says ara ara~ so i reply with one too
because i talk to bots
hi bestiessss :3c nya!
Sam please
ara ara now that one is unique
nyaaa
oh i cant
lmfaoooo
nya is not one of the things i would say
someone replied to me with that once though
me too never again
i also accidentally caused my guild to go a tiny bit crazy :3
okay i should really sleep i-
lmaoo i only remember that one of my first friends in middle school said it a LOT but that was before ppl actually texted so i never see it online
yes
go sleep
ahahaha
dont resist melatonin
lmfao i remember people would overuse xD
wild times
im gonna *try* to sleep but im not gonna be surprised if i sleep at 4-5 again smh
omg yeah
i got into an xD phase half a year ago bc sooo many people i talked to used it but not anymore
i probably shouldn't have posted my lazy halloween costume, i'll prob never hear the end of it hahah
oh my fave thing is the cat face :3
i do it all the time
ehhh people may just forget unless you bring it up more :D
:3 i started using it because of you lmaoo im v easily influenced
idk about that people went crazy over it
not that i get why
o wait was that the one that was a genshin reference or another thing
nope
it’s just me with a pair of fox ears and a tail
nothing special lmfao
ah still sounds cute tho and very low effort!
it isssss
best halloween costume ever
i think i originally took the pictures just in case my middle college yearbook didn’t have enough halloween pics in my junior year
but it was never used ahaha
oh wow i would never submit a pic to yearbook if i didnt have to hehe
lmaooooo i was in yearbook so i kinda felt bad for the halloween team and was gonna submit it
but they got it figured out
ahh ig its a diff story if you were a part of the team lol
thats good tho :3
i’m gonna go for the night, goodnight everyone ! :3
gm besties :3c
night night :angelWBlobsleep:
did you just say good morning-
better have been a typo :D
gm :)
Good morning!
https://tenor.com/view/good-morning-morning-good-day-happy-gif-11824011
good morning zoe!!! :3
good morning aerin and zoe!!
good morning sam!!!! :3
hiiii yall
good morning alexxxx :3
gm alex :)
gm yall‼️‼️
https://tenor.com/view/cat-kitty-%e9%bb%91%e8%b2%93-gif-14994757
aww cutee
omg zoe that’s so cuteeeee
its how I feel when I see messages
also no mentors are on rn
okay that’s really cute :3
Professors are online though!
y e s
I need to do APS homework
bettt
https://tenor.com/view/kitty-cat-depress-my-life-sad-gif-13253623
I haven't started it yet
me too
I just  realized it's gonna be due when Im at work
./ree
ooh damn
there’s also ev 2 to do
ev2 is quick tbh
true
That was due this morning right?
was it? lmao oops
i think it's due at 9??
Does this mean we want the highest integers?...
Like adding them together gives you the best solution kinda thing?
um seems like
I swear APS instructions cause me stress
fr tho LMAO
i'm like ???? most of the time
it sounds like multiplication though
when someone says “product” doesn’t that usually mean multiply?
it sounds like they’re asking you to make sure that you find the pair of numbers that make the largest positive product
ooh true
but then how can 4 and 0 be answers?
Does it mean 4 * 1
= 4
and 4,1 to list what needs to be multiplied?
OOPS I DID TEXT TO SPEECH
i think it's either asking for the pair that needs to be multiplied to get the maximum OR the highest number on the list?? idk
i interpreted that as either submitting [4,1] or just [4] since it's four that maximizes not really 1
but it could also be what alex said
https://tenor.com/view/what-day-is-it-huh-what-confused-anime-gif-16694798
https://tenor.com/view/nervous-anime-terrified-scared-frightened-gif-16455119
Can you give me 4 random integers, positive, negative, or 0
[ -3, 5, 7, 0]
Thank you ❤️
no problem :3
zoe, we have discussion in 2 minutes, you could ask for clarification then :3
either i can't spell or google can't spell
i swear we spelled the same thing i-
what-
huh-
it looks the same unless im tripping
i don't know what happened
i knowwww
omg its a joke
google does that to "show recursion" or smth idk
LMAO
it happened to me before LOL
no way
LMAO
lmfao bruh
waitttt
i-
thats kinda funny
omfg-
funny but i hate it
what ucsd's revelle parking looks like rn:
💀
when we saw that i was so upset omg
oh man
ucsd please construct parking lots
oh well, can't drive anyway
they need a giant parking structure
eighth college = parking structure
fr please
omg yes
and i hope they make it a pretty parking structure too
my lungs hurt from laughing i-
what breakout room? :o
hi jennyyyyyyy
hellu :3
okay so it wasn't a breakout room
i dropped by acm and then went back to main session
and gary was there
and it was great :3
I missed Gary?!
Dang
yes
He shoulda came by WIC
ohh i didnt even realize the main sesh was a thing!
he was hanging out in the main room lmfao
i wasn't sure if i wanted to check out any of the other groups so i took a break there
and then gary appeared
and then i never left ahahah
He is still in the mainroom!
I LEFT CAUSE I DIDNT KNOW
This is a betrayal
I’m low key tired of the computer though what do I do
honestly same i kinda got hit with zoom fatigue
which is weird cause usually i'm in front of my computer for hours
I was okay when I was with WIC but then as soon as I turned it off I feel like death
If you have any more questions, please ask away!!
i thought my humanities were waived for revelle and they weren't
instead they waived my sciences
Why do they make it physically impossible to get from one class to another by they start and finish?
Like for DSC 10 and DSC 96 you have 10 minutes to travel halfway across campus
How does that work
UCSD was designed to have separate colleges, so by design it just makesthings far
But why aren’t the DSC classes near each other
It’s not making sense in my brain
Oh i didnt even look at where my classes are yet and i dont wanna 😭
why does discord have such weird emote names
like why is disappointed_relieved a thing
ahahah same i haven't actually given it any thought lmfao
I have been trying to like
Plan out my schedule
😥
And I realize some of the classes on my four year plan aren’t available rn
i need to do that
yeppp same with mine
SO IM LIKE: well I guess I gotta look
And some classes are filled !
So like I can’t take music ;-;
invest in scooters, bikes, roller skates, or skateboards !!!
i only planned a list i wanted, but not when im taking them yet and im already getting confused ahhh
Yes, some classes are only offered in certain quarters
ahahah i'm looking at their default plan and crossing off a bunch of whatever doesn't apply to me which is a fair bit
Yeah.. or like I had to add a math course cause I didn’t take AP Calc in high school
So I’m hesitant to do anything that’s not a GE or what I’m planning for a minor
ohhhh that's a fair concern
Maybe some of your base ge's can be swapped around?
Hum can’t be and I don’t wanna take physics since it uses basic calculus
a trick i've seen some students do is take some ges at community college over summer
ive tried to overlap as much as i can but i have to take so many random courses for ge's
I’m thinking of Chemistry and Buology
idk where they were in their progress towards graduation but it was something i saw often during summers
I’m going to have to take math 18, 20C over summer to be on track for DSC 40
Then the next summers I’m gonna do HUM
i'm actually kinda curious about the hum classes
i only got 1 waived
You got one waived?
is that the revelle writing course?
yeah
Yes
i took more than enough college classes to technically have them all waived
oh wow i didnt realize any of the college specific ones could be waived
but they were like nope
you can check your degree audit
that's how i found out revelle decide to take my science instead of my humanities
the degree audit is in tritonlink :3
that's so strange... do they specify anything about it?
oh yeah ive looked at it but i basically knew the few classes i had waived anyways from aps lol
honestly i'm so glad they took my science, my chemistry and physics were not fun
plus the physics i took wasn't lab physics ahahah
oh thats good then!
but idk what to expect with humanities ahahah
i think i actually barely need any more stem courses which is so strange to me because i've said my whole life that i liked stem >>>>> humanities
ahahah
i'm like humanities > stem because i can make more things up ahahah
science and math were always my fav subjects ahahha i hated eng and history
but now, i just need math 18
and im done with math probably
(i dont wanna do machine learning or else i need so many more math classes LOL i forgot all of calc tho)
oh wow
that's super niceeeeee
i have to retake calc bc since i dropped it a while back
i'm looking at the humanities sequences for revelle
and they're kinda funny
im hoping that i dont end up hating cogsci because today i  made a list of what i want to take
oh what do yall need to take?
it's like whap
honestly it all sounds like history
blegh
i did quite well in whap so i think i'll be fine
https://students.ucsd.edu/my-tritonlink/tools/
how bad is it to have 2 finals on the same day
Degree audit is something I always check every quarter to see where I am at, and helps a lot to plan for the future. Its nice to see what classes you already have credit for from AP credits and CC courses
depends what classes
I have DSC 10 and Math 4C on the same day
i was planning on changing my major kinda so i didnt really take too close of a look on the audit
For finals
Which sounds horrid
2 finals on the same day isn't the worst, but can be esp if its a math class. Usually humanities are an essay you turn in online. My friend had 3 finals in one day and its the absolute worst
What’re you changing to?
^^^
its basically the sixth college CAT writing course thing + cogs 9
oh i just wanted to add a specialization which changes the elective stuff kinda
ohhhh specialization!!! which one???
but if i end up hating this major i rly dont know what ill do lol
i think design and interaction :)
doesnt require all those extra math classes lol
ohhhh that's nice
practically everyone i know is like TAKE A CS MINOR WITH YOUR MAJOR
so watch me not sleep :3
oh i used to wanna take a cs minor
but
it's fine though cause i know a few other night owls lmfao
i still really dont wanna do those math classes LOL
i mean i figure as long as i pass the math classes, i can make my humanities carry my gpa lmfao
You will be fine. Cogs 9 is a very fun and chill class. Whos the prof this quarter? And CAT final will most likely be a paper so if you dont procrastinate you should be fine
Fleischer
CAPES looks solid so
If capes lookin solid then you chillin 🙂
I took it last winter and it was a super chill and easy class
yessir lmao i was looking at the CAPES for the CAT sequence and some are yikes
thanks @prorick
In general, for the writing sequences, your grade depends on your TA, so def make a good impression, and hope your TA is nice
gotcha
can anyone from revelle tell me how hard the humanities reqs are?
@John._.
He’s the mentor from Revelle, he’s gonna hate me for pinging him so much. XD
He’s my role model XD
ahahah
ack just talked to my parents and theyre just like "yeah you should definitely minor in cs"
welp time to look at everything again!
good luck jennyyyy
depending on what your cogs subdomain is / what your advisor said there might be a lot of overlap
basically ap lit
oh okay then that's not that bad at all lmao
i took the college equivalent of ap lit so i think i should be fine
hum 1 and 2 are 6 unit classes so theres a lot of reading and writing time commitment
try to take kristina markman if you can
my advisor just answered a few of the questions i had but i had no intention of minoring at the time lol so i dont really know
i feel like i may not even be able to get into the classes i need though
you could always email them!!!
i'm p sure you need to email your college's advisor
oh righttt i forgot we could submit q's tyy
technically i have space for 20 more classes as of now if i take 4 classes per quarter and everything fulfills a req lol
@John._. do u have time later to talk about data science?
i'm finally planning things out and i keep smudging my writing i- 
ah im doing everything online
You could graduate early
that's honestly a great idea lmao
i'm expecting to miss a lot of classes i need tho, and i was actually scared i couldnt graduate in 4 years before i committed to ucsd lol
pick up a minor!
oh wait theres no harm in declaring a minor and not completing it right?
I don’t think so
i mean u could always take classes that align with the minor?
@prorick
without officially declaring
He’s the all knowing minor person
I asked him about it earlier
oh i thought declaring might help me plan but i dont rly know
Is there a chat for random questions I come up with like: is Michael’s favorite food lasagna?
we need that
someone could prboably make one :D
i will probably have really random questions
@John._. can we have a chat with random questions?
also i just looked at my remaining revelle ge's and i don't have much lmao
To get to know our mentors better
y e s
Lucky
lmaooo zoe i technically will have six years of college by the time i graduate
I have like 1 year of extra college I guess? But I don’t think it applies for UCSD
I took AP’s but didn’t take the AP test and did community college
ohhhhhhhhhhh that's cool!
i spent 2 years as a full time cc student :3
while in high school ofc
honestly though cc is wild, i had one cc on semester and that was my main one but i also did some classes with a diff one on quarter and their breaks *never* aligned
@Wonder Oz he might be busy rn but I'm pretty sure he's hella down and has time to talk about it with u!
alright thanks
btw, there’s some webinars (stages, if you want the discord term) going on in the UCSD 2025 server this week! the cs and eng ones already happened, but the college ones are coming up - server link here https://discord.gg/6rGpBksv5S
ahahah i forgot about those despite getting pings for it ahahah
oh i havent looked at that one oops
also we cant waitlist classes first pass right?
so according to what i heard yesterday at the revelle thingy i attended they said we don't have a first and second pass for this upcoming enrollment
but if you're not sure, you should def drop by your college's web registration webinar or watch the recording if they have one up
correct! no 1st/2nd pass for your enrollment for your first quarter
but during your following quarters, you are correct @jennosaur♡ no waitlists on first pass
oh interesting so i can enroll in as many as i want?
i believe ther'es still a limit but not sure what it is
the last webinar is tmrw so im just waiting for recordings since theyre all spis times lol
i think it's 20 before the first day of the quarter
ohh ok
also hi josh :3
helloooooo
wow now you're orange!!!
how is it 7-
because time flies :3
yupppp
tim flies but i have had 2 hour gaps throughout my events for the day so i've had no time to nap 🥲
saddd
i nap every spis lunch
even the ~30 min before mentor lunch lmaoo
i had all summer to sleep
but instead i stayed up late
i napped *sooooo* much during my final semester of high school, i can't tell you what was happening in any of my classes
josh, are you in a different time zone or do you just like staying up late?
i have trouble falling asleep haha
im usually up much later than that as well
ohhhhh that makes a lot of sense, i'm usually up at that time unless i've brute forced myself into sleeping earlier
you should join our 12 am convos if you have timeeee
lolol for sure
https://resume-parser.vercel.app/
not the spoiler thats next week
SORRY BESTIE
I FIXED IT
@ferreti m come back
be back :)
i think i finished planning my four years, my brain hurts and unless i space things out i'll be graduating by fall 2024 i-
girl🧍‍♀️🧍‍♀️
hi alexxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
hiiii
ok but how tho omg
i have to space stuff out but it would be with a bs in cog sci w/ my specialization + cs minor
all that's contingent on me actually getting classes as planned
but i had 90.5 units to start
wait how are u spacing it out pls😭😭
i'm not lmfao
i think i have 50 idk
i have to put in some of those "fun" classes because rn it's just jam packed full of my major + proposed minor classes
ooh okay fs fs
i just didn't put in the "fun" classes cause lazy
felt LMFAO
i need to do mine lmfaooo
i only put one and that was literally a marine bio class
i wanna do film lowk lol
film!!
i feel *slightly*  pressured by my parents to take a bunch of cog sci electives
omg film sounds fun!!!!!!!!
ooh fr
yeah i think i have a few too many cog sci electives on my thing but i also stopped counting cause it got difficult
numbers be wilding fr fr
@.mentors does anyone have experience in postgresql and wanna teach a noob 👉 👈
sql? isn't that a language?
i know mySQL
i only know some languages by name cause i've heard them mentioned in passing lmfao, sql was one of them
yeah same😵‍💫😵‍💫
uhhh
hi sam!!!
trying to add postgresql to a heroku website
ooh
but i don't know anything about it or about node.js which is the thing i'm using ahaha
i think it does
i'd ask my brother for you since he knows more coding than i do, but i think i thoroughly traumatized him last time asking him to check what i was coding in python
he's supposed to be taking a java class
well i'd say the best base place to start is just learning about some general SQL
sometimes i look at sql and my brain goes "squirrel"
i just looks so much like squirrelllllllllll
will do!! i'm looking at tutorials and some of it makes sense
i had a realization
if i did math as much as i write, maybe i wouldn't have forgotten all my calculus
Am I blind or did the pet channel go away
it still exists
#pet-pictures
Ty
np :3
anyone do anything interesting today?
I play spoopy game
You?
what is spoopy game
i had a driving lesson, does that count
i play spoopy game
You play Dead by Daylight?
Honestly, horrifying game, perfect nightmare fuel, too much for me.
Zombies == my death
i do not play dead by daylight
Aw
i was playing trivia murder party on jackbox
honestly the most interesting thing i did was draw a cat 30 minutes ago
but my friends play dbd!
jacbox 👀
it does, i still can't drive :3
yeah aha
i've seen people play it, it's very bloody :3
cool, neither can I, apparently :3
also hi ethan, sam, and zoe
we're full sorry :(
hi aerin
my mom was yelling at me half the time when i drove one time
thats ok, im trying to just read and sleep early tonight
sleep early!!!
lmao my mom does that every time i drive
that reminds me i gotta brute force my sleep
maybe all asian mothers share one brain cell to scream at children learning to drive lmfao
🥲
i don't really see any rush to learn though
i won't even be taking a car to sd anywayyyyyy
yea lol
ill forget everything in the year
technically i only need to learn enough to pass the driving test
if i can pass then i can get my license
and not drive
y'all wanna see the cat i drew?
yes!!
don't mind the fact that i drew this on the back of my four year plan
awww\
frog cat
y e s
i saw a picture of a cat with a bear hat thing
but  couldn't figure out how to do the bear hat so i did a frog hat
this is late but i loveeee dbd
it's so fun
i don't play it super often anymore but it's so fun
I have heart attacks every time
I just won a game against legion
He spooked me
MOOD
im so bad w scary games
Wanna play a game rn?
i can't atm haha
It had a big update though, did you update it?
Awww
maybe tomorrow tho? maybe a few people would play during game night 👀
I will heart a heart attack. Let's do it. xD
hahaha
I am so bad with horror, but I like playing this game because my friends do, and I wanna be included
but I legit scream, it's so scary
relatable
Here I can add you on steam wanna dm me your friend number thing?
zoeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
i wanna watch you guys playyyyyyyyyyyy
Ooh
We arent gonna play tonight 😮
i knowwwwwww
We were gonna do it tomorrow
y es
and ping meeeeeee :3
idk i like watching games more than i like playing them
Im getting off my game tonight, I gotta be awake for lecture xD
right the lecture
Yes lecture XD
i know i should be getting to bed buuuuuuuuuuut also staying up late
I was playing with a friend cause he was at work all day
But like sitting in chairs for so long hurts
Maybe I should do class on my bed
But then I feel like I couldn’t have my camera on
Cause I feel like that’s weird
i sit in a chair for hours and i feel nothing lmao
Like I’m just taking notes in bed and can’t see anything
ohhhhhhhhhh
Or I’ll like roll around
lmaoooo
Too many embarrassing things could happen
It’s not worth it
i think the only embarrassing thing that could pawsibly happen rn would be me making random faces at the camera
XD why would you do that
idk where i show up on zooms for everyone else, but if i think no one is watching i make a weird face
well it's funnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
I don’t know that seems wonky to me
I get self conscious when I have to talk then my zoom like shows up
In front of everyone
0/10
plus if someone does catch me making a funny face, i bet it makes them laugh
I never look at people except professors when they do lecture
Cause I wouldn’t want anyone to look at me
So I try to not look
ohhhh that's fair
Sometimes mentors like Diego have funny backgrounds though
And I feel inclined to comment on them
yes they dooooooooo
i like looking at people's backgrounds
especially when they swap them around
I’m just happy, with Prothit’s amazing recommendation and approval, that my classes are mostly figured out
For this quarter at least
yayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy that's great!!!!!
idk what i'm doing this quarter
XD
i made and promptly forgot what i'm taking
I started planning cause we have to pick classes in like 6 days
How scary
like i have the thingy and then i forgot
So you do know just not right now?
i think picking classes isn't that scary compared to everything else
well it's somewhere
i painted with my friend but the paintings r horrendous 🤣🤣
i don't remember but i know i did it
well at least you had fun!!!
I think it’s more scary than public speaking
oh that reminds me zoe, are you going to get back 4 blood?
yeaa it was an interesting experience. we gave up in the middle. also yesh hellooo
What does that mean?
really? i must be desensitized then
isn't it the game that comes after dead by daylight or did i remember wrong? it's been a while
Well I’m not scared of public speaking
I just want to be academically ready, challenged, and like good
that is fairrrrrrrrrrrrr
That’s what college is for me XD academics.
oh college is social time for me
I want it to be good and go as planned cause it’s important
College is really expensive and I wanna make sure I don’t take unnecessary classes or like stuff that costs more
Cause it’s not gonna be easy to pay for it
so trueeeeee
I already feel kinda bad for staying in the dorms when I could commute
i think commuting can change the experience you have though
But mom doesn’t want me to commute and says college dorm experience is really important
cause my local school is sjsu and it's a full blown commuter school
so it's a lot more like a community college where everyone just goes to class and that's it
Idek how I would commute because all the parking would be full
that is also trueeeeeeeeeee
It’s hard cause mom tells me not to worry but I’m like
I have 3 siblings 1 already in college 1 graduating next year
And college is expensive
oh fr it is crazy expensive

https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/775661361187258438.gif?v=1
It’s so stressful
yes
it is stressful
oh btw i got my zombie games all muddled apparently back for blood was the one after left for dead or something
That makes sense
The only horror game I play is dead by daylight
And I have to take breaks because I get so scared that I’m shaking and sweating
i think i've seen someone play it?
But I’m getting better with it
yayyyyyy go zoe!!! :3
I’m just a wimp XD
i think i watched dead by daylight 2 once
i need to check
It’s like
Scary killer chases you and then pits you on hooks
You have to complete generators in order to escape
There are tools and stuff to help or hinder you
yeah i saw dead by daylight 2 last month
It was on sale I think
it was indeed difficult
oops
ugh
I bought it with money I earned
my brain did another inside out thing
XD
i give up
it was left for dead 2
why am i like this
XD
i guess it makes sense since it was so bloody
like the left for dead was bloody and so was back for blood, i should have knownnnnn
https://tenor.com/view/dbd-dead-by-daylight-ashupawn-bhvr-meg-thomas-gif-21960460
This is a screenshot I guess
I don’t know what killer that is
But there is a palette you can throw
The killer has to walk around it or kick it
You run lots of loops in this game
You can also blind killers with the flashlight
And crouch to hide or be softer
oh that is cool!!!!!!!!!
i just googled it and i think i've seen the cover around but never the game
Yeah I was unfamiliar with it for a long time
My friends said I shouldn’t watch cause I’d get nightmares
i think the first horror game i ever saw played was outlast
And I do get nightmares XD
awwwwwwwwwwwwww
Oh I don’t know that one
then i think after that it was silent hill series
Honestly, John makes me wanna go back and play league of legends
you used to play?
But I uninstalled that game and plan to keep it that way
also hi sammmmmmmmmm
sorry, but league 🤢
I used to play too much
I have over 500k points in Morgana
lmaooooo
https://tenor.com/view/angel-lolol-league-of-legend-morgana-lol-gif-14047264
This one
oooh she's prettyyyyyyyy
She’s super pretty
i only really remember the k/da members lmao
She’s magical.
BUT SEEIN JOHN PLAY IT MAKES ME WANNA PLAY IT
she looks magicalllllll
ITS NOT GOOD FOR ME
lmaoooooooo
She is sisters with Kayle
https://tenor.com/view/riot-games-riot-morgana-kayle-league-of-legends-gif-19025539
oooh she can flyyyyyyy
actually those six wings remind me of the key for resident evil village
I don’t know what that means
@ferreti I know it’s bad
I’m holding myself back
League is so salty
But seeing friends play it makes me wanna just hop on and play
that's the six winged key from resi 8
Spikes
no i get it
Man Morgana was so fun to play
I just don’t like the toxic people
It made me angry
Kinda like Recursion, but a million times worse
ohhhh yeah those kinds of people suck
Of my anger were recursive and had looped at least 20 times
for the longest time i only knew one person who played league and he had *i s s u e s*
That’s how angry I’d get
oh my! that's not good 0-0
People are just insufferable
Like bad people
for real
they can be
why do 99% of people who play league suck xDDDDDDD
So so true, or they’re so competitive
i don't know, my biggest mistake was dating that dude
and then i dumped him
I fall under competitive too honestly
good for you
and now he stalks me
Oh
oh that's not so good
Get a restraining order
lmaooo zoe
Aerin why do so many people stalk you
I think you should talk to the police
it;s the same dude though
And an adult
@crossboy do you know law stuff
he's the creepy stalker dude who sent me his contact info a year after i blocked him
Does she need to like
Get a judge
Or a lawyer
For a restraining order
unfortunately, one of the other girls he stalked said that police did nothing
and what he did with that person was wayyyy worse cause he knew where they lived lmao
That’s why you get a restraining order
i'm in no immediate danger lmao
Then he can get arrested
Say you feel unsafe
~~he should have been arrested a year ago but wasn't~~
it's no biggie
Aerin you gotta travel in a pack
i knowwwwwwwwwwwwwww
This sounds like a biggie
I’m seriously concerned
pfft i have four exes and he's the only one creepily attached but it's fine
I feel like parents should be involved
Like this can develop to worse things
i know
but it's fine
i know what goes on in his brain
he'll let go of me pretty soon cause his "dream" is to find his "the one" at college at a bus stop
I would have to say I don’t agree because anything can happen in peoples brain
i highly doubt i'm in any danger
i'm leaving in a little more than a month :3
If he shows up on campus you get the police involved
he's not going to come to ucsd lmao
If you won’t then I will or someone else will because that’s not okay
i already had my school's counselor block where i'm going to college
Well that’s good
yeah!!! dw though, i'll be all good :3
Idk Aerin I still think more adults need to be involved.
but zoeeeeeeeeee
i *am* an adult
I don’t want to hear any buts
What he is doing ISNT okay
i know
honestly idk if he stopped or not lmao
I know you’re an adult but I don’t feel like we are true adults
ahahahahahah
then how old is a true adult
Like that kinda stuff is scary and can mess with you mentally
A 35 year old
Unless they act like a child
Maybe 50
It depends
It throws me for a loop cause I can’t tell how old people are
So in my brain Niema is like 30
Curt is like 40
And Gary is 45
Because he has facial hair
lmaoooooo
But I don’t know how accurate those numbers are
But I’d view all our professors as true adults
I think it depends on maturity level
And knowledge
The more knowledge the more adult
@ragdoll kitten are you gonna join the WIC club Lindsey helps with?
I think I’m going to, it looks like a lot of fun
I kinda got sucked in to that one though I wanted to check the D3S one too
i’m not sure if i wanna join that club yet :3
i’m probably going to wait until i’m on campus to decide what clubs
Do you have one in mind you want?
Or that makes sense
not particularly tbh
I’d wanna join a club with cooking if there was one
I like cooking
But that’s not really data related lol
Unless we count every recipe as an algorithm
i don't think every club you join has to be related to your major thoughhhhhhhh
That’s true
i remember when one of the ucs visited my school they said they had a costco club
Bro
Costco is awesome
it isssssssssss
i used to always go to the books section
They just eat Costco muffins or something XD
I have a Costco muffin every day for breakfast
Except we ran out today
That’s not always true
Sometimes I’ll have egg
But I like muffin
their muffins are biggggggggg
I know that’s why it’s great
I had the muffin then didn’t eat again until 7
You just have enough food for a while
wow that's a long time
Yeah I ate the muffin at like 8 aM
But I think I got hungry in the middle of coding and ignored it
still,,, isn;t that around 11 hours
i say that like i don't have disordered eating
Huh
I don’t understand
Sorry
disordered eating just means i don't eat on a regular schedule
Ohhh
sometimes i eat all three meals and sometimes it's just one
I think eating two meals or more is acceptable
https://tenor.com/view/nodding-crossed-arms-pikachu-eyes-closed-pokemon-gif-15194868
Any less is concerning cause you gotta feed your body to work
lmaoooooooooooooo
In college if there is a kitchen near by the dorm stuff
I hope there is a toast
And then I can make bagels
Or eggs and stuff
oh bagels are fun!!!
sry this topic already passed but im so bad at league
LOL
hi lydiaaaaaa dw
there's no such thing as a passed topic
That’s okay
LOL tyty
League is bad
sigh
time doesn't really function in my brain anyway
omg LOL
So you just stop playing and it’s okay
helloo
i suck at league too :D
Hi Jenny
yeaa i just stopped playing
hi jennyyyyyyyyyy
i get so frustrated
You also stop
with MYSELF
i havent played in 2 years
Don’t feed the salt hole
LOL
omg 2 yearas LOL
i took my melatonin so i might disappear when it hits me hard
i only play if my friends really really really want to play
but mostly i play val
I haven’t played in over a year I think?
even tho i also suck at that game
oo wowie
I don’t know
i started val recently 👀 i suck
I’m really bad  at time
ahh okok
:00000
same tho
aerin sleep when you even feel it a tiny bit!!
i knowwwwwwww
i played for abt a yr now but im just,, the same
💀
Yes go to sleep
gaming is not my thing
omg me with fgo
yeaa u should if ur tired!
I try hard a bit too much in games
Gaming 😎
i'm not tired yetttttt
hi ethannnnnnnn
ah i started like a month ago and im still very bad i dont know any terms
lool
hi aerin what’s up
helloo
I play FF14 and I’m like LETS DO ULTIMATE CONTENT
nothing much, ethan, wbu?
It’s so bad XD
i made a lot of gamer friends and i legit could not understand their convos
oml ff14
i know some people who play i think
I showered
lmao
That’s about it
Ff14 is fun
Except when it’s not
omg one of my friends asked to queue w me and i said i sucked and i was new and he was still goin on about how i didnt know what the heck cubby and ct stuff meant lmao
I like playing with friends but it can get grind-t
brUH
Cubby?
smh
Like a cubby?
valo has the weirdest terms 😩
honestly idk what they r still LOLLL
Like the hole in a wall
whenevr they give me callouts it makes me more confused
i think usually its some strange side thing
im jst like ????????? WHERE????????/
I tried to get into Val twice
same and i just frantically spasm my mouse oops
But super competitive games just aren’t my thing
LOLLL SAMEEEE
Cubby???
Also my computer sucks ass
one of my friends was like lydia i realized ur mouse shakes a lot when ur shooting
So I can’t run it well anyway
-0- im just freaking out
oo icic
yeah the thing is, if i get better i start getting too competitive and before i get better i feel so bad for doing so badly lmaoo
omg LOOOL
my brother spent a long time picking a gaming mouse
YEAAA
i relate so hard
and i didn't get it
o gosh my brother does the same thing
zoe it's ok its a weird specific gaming term for somewhere on the map that i still dont get
Mice are so expensive
always looking at keyboards and mouses
yea i hae no idea what cubby is T_T
I have a keyboard that disgusts people
i also heard gaming pcs are different from regular pcs
o
Cause it’s split in two XD
I have a couple friends who are super into keyboards
yea they r
ikr i like my laptop keyboards better i cant type on the other ones
show
but i don't build the pcs in my family, my dad does
what the heck
Ooh I’ve seen them
ooo
split in 2?
i wanna try building a pc
Same
i think the shells are really pretty
But they expensive
i wanted to buy a desktop and put it in my dorm but idk how efficient that would be
yeaa they r
worth the investment maybe
Like the keys
Lmao same here
wot THE
oh my
zoe what is that
🤣
that would be hard for me to type with
my hands are small
i would be so confusdd
It’s my keyboard
zoe is it weird for you to use a normal keyboard if youre used to that??
idkk i heard some ppl do bring desktops
I type like an old man so I wouldn’t be able to use that
It’s really nice for my wrists
omg LOL
o interesting
Yea def
wait what's this mean?
No I can use a normal one my WPM is still like 78
oh that's v important!!!!
mmm
I just prefer this one cause it’s nice for my wrists and is big
i had a scare for arthritis/carpal tunnel and yeah
I can reach all the way to 6
oh wow i cant imagine it but i guess as long as your fingers are aligned, it wouldnt be too diff?
using stuff that's good for your wrists is v v v important
Not necessarily split between two hands, sometimes my hands cross over to the other half of the keyboard
And then I use the number pad on my mouse
oo
ohhh i have never seen that before
The trick is typing properly cause you just move your hands the same
my brother types fast but it's only aswd according to him
that's literally the only part of the keyboard he's fast with
XD
yeah i think my typing isnt the best lol i used my left on 3/4 of the keyboard
It’s important to be able to type a decent speed
so i laugh at him cause i type way faster with all the letters
Anyone interested in helping me build a pc if/when I get one 😊
s u r e
I don’t know how I bought a prebuilt one
i would just break it </3
Me
i mean i've seen some disassembled before?
I am scared to clean my computer tbh
i think i had to try to put one together in 7th grade but i forgot 100% of that class
I’ll need to buy compressed air some day
plus my dad built the one i use when i'm not on the laptop
oo nice
https://tenor.com/view/phone-line-sleep-kitten-fall-asleep-gif-13994725
This is how I feel
Good night

Oh I’m being banished XD
I guess goodnight then

^
i am a terrible example
I am tired XD
ruining your sleep schedule is not good for you
I do wanna rest but that was funny
Sorry I tried to be silly

I will take this chance to actually be banished and sleep
Goodnight

Good morning

Oh fuck I need to sleep soon

hi guys it is past midnight
good night to you too ethan

LOL
ethan

😔
oop
that's a big oop
I ended up watching YouTube
lydia youd better not call right now morning >:(
and also why i refuse to say when i'm going to bed
no one has fixed my sleep schedule and no one shall lmaoooooooooooooo
its still summer you can fix it in college!
ahahahahahah
i always tell myself that
and then a week later i'm back to going to be past 1 am
literally me
LOL
my sleep schedule is wrecked
T_T
but uhhh college is a fresh start???
lmaooooooooo
i sleep at 10pm then the next day i sleep at 3am
tbh now i have more incentive to sleep late bc classes are a few hrs later 😩
idk why i like being up late so much, i also can't see anything when it's dark
idk i feel like sleeping is a waste of time LOL
omgggg
I haven’t slept before 12 in like three months 😭
one thing i've learned is no night classes
most of the time you end up sleeping
woT
i like the night better
o
oh?
same i like night
the professors are super boring
its quiet lolol
mind you i was taking math night classes
i think i have one schedueld for like 4-5 or smth idk if that counts
it's so hard to stay awake and also imagine walking back to dorms in the dark
i feel like i get more awake as the night goes on tho
I’m gonna have a 6 pm math class lmaoo
which class?
Or is it 5
oo scarryy
20c
i said that too and then i fell asleep in my calc bc
and had to drop
oh-
i have 5:00 discussion --0-
Wait
Which day
i remember having a 9 am discussion last year and it sucked
yeah i tried to make mine later but idk it feels weird
uhhh
wednesday
!
Oh, I think mine is Thursday
ahh
i think my only before 11 am classes are my backup backup ones
yea i dont want later classes bc i just feel like ill feel as if the day just went past
ooo icic
thats true ugh
but i dont wanna wake up early
honestly i don't want early classes cause it's cold in the morning
i don't really like cold weather
ahh that is very true
i like cold weather more because i can layer
but if its too hot you cant strip that much lmaoo
sameee
LOL strip
i've been outside a classroom in the middle of winter so i decided never again
I have a GE class that’s gonna be at 8 in the morning across campus 😭
i love layering
*unskin yourself*
and feeling all bundled up
yessss
OMG AHAHHAHAHA WTH
wow you're gonna be walking far, ethan
and ew ethan why thats so early
o WOw
i cannot wake up before 8
Looking for alternatives but no luck lol
i wont do it voluntarily ahahah
rippp
Everything’s either full or conflicts with one of my other planned courses
i should honestly check
but also do i really want to
so many of my planned courses have a 10 min break but estimated 15+ min walking but i also do not dare bike up or down warren idk
o gosh
ehhh it doesnt make a diff if you check now or the day before lol
im scared to get a bike bc i feel like ima end up just walking uphill and being unable to ride it
lool
exactyl! or the horror injury stories
ikkk
or just the one wheel locked on the rack
LOL
so sad
Oh yea didn’t they say it’s gonna be hella crowded too
we'll just get exercise </3
LOL yeah
o rlly!?
mhm it might be slow too
oo i do need that -0-
Same lol
i have no idea what to expect when it comes to how many people there will be everywhere
Who needs the gym when you have passing period
samee
LOL true
literally! living next to the gym isnt useful for me lmao
From watching vlogs and stuff, it looks pretty bad lol
Especially since so many freshmen came in this year
not sure why i never thought about watching vids from before qtine lol
yeahhh and many sophomores also dont know their way
itll be hectic
sameee
I will know my way, bc I always overplay routes and stuff
oo trueeee i keep forgetting the sophs r basically in the same boat at us
i'll figure out routes after seeing what classes i actually get :(((
LOL i wanna do this
oh yeah random q, is any cs major planning on taking cse 11?
That is a good idea, I should probably do that too
lowkey worried ill miss accidentally pick somethig i cant walk tho
im taking cse 8a!
im math-cs doing 11
Undeclared doing 11
i was worried ill be overwhelmed and it doesnt hurt to make sure that i have a solid foundation
:o do you guys have more spots??
oo
theyre all already wl for me
Oh fuck lemme check
they take people off waitlist for cse classes
Wait don’t SPIS kids get priority or smth
yeppp and you might need those lower div creds anyways?
so everything should be waitlisted
Yea that
oh really?
hmm i didnt think i could get it so i was gonna try for another course i wasnt even gonna take til next year...
o wot
i was thinking that cs majors had a lot more spots bc every DI for me just says 10 spots
samee mine did that too
hmm now i dont know if i should try to get the class or not lol i was just gonna wait til next quarter
things might be even worse then idk
Which class?
cse 11
the CSE classes have a special kind of enrollment - they'll say they're full with 0 seats available because none of the seats are actually released. You waitlist into the class, then you'll get an email in a little bit that says you can enroll in the class (they give you a special permission that lets you enroll in the fake "full" class).
So you should definitely waitlist into the CSE classes you want!
ohhh that's so strange
ty tho!! might redo my schedule then lol
yup it's weird but it's just to make sure people have priority properly
not sure how my priority will be as a cogsci major but i think i'll try to get it instead of linear alg then :)
ahahahah i'm retaking all my math :3
if i can actually get the class, my two back to back ones will both be center then!
and will get rid of the one in wlh lol
eh we'll see how it goes
XD
You guys need to sleep more
no!
Yes you do
Remember the other day the mentors said 7-8-9 hours of sleep
oh yeah
How much sleep did you get?
um
Not that much >:O
can i decline to comment
It’s okay you don’t have to comment
I just know you didn’t
🥲
We should just set a bedtime for this chat then you all have to sleep XD
Like chat bedtime is 12:30 AM
That way it’s possible to get enough sleep
I got 6 hours
Plus thirty minutes
Oops
i-
we have bedtime now?
alsooooo good morning everyoneeee
Not official but I recommend it
Good morning
ah that’s fair lmao
i think some of us could do with more sleep ahahah

i like hanging out with everyoneeeeeeeeeeee
i don't want it to endddddddd
girl dw we’re all gonna see each other irl soon :D!
that is trueeeeeeeeee
that will be so fun!!!! :3
fr fr
We could all plan, like before classes start to get lunch together at UTC
Or something like that
SPIS group together
We have to plan Karoake, food, and other stuff
oh yeah dont we have a few days before starts after moving in :3
i think so?
yep
classes start 23rd i think
f u n :3
very
ooh fs fs
SPIS bonfire??
say less omg
that would be quite fun!!!
great idea jared!!! :3
i have yet to go to a bonfire
i remember hearing about people doing bonfires at the end of a semester to burn all their notes and stuff lmao
what constitutes a bonfire
beach, bonfire pit, fire
i will burn my notes from hs bro
ah then technically i have been at one bonfire
i have yet to do that HAHA
good idea
i wanna burn my notes but im a hoarder
ahahahah that sounds so simple
i'm not allowed to
i also got some old sat and act books HAHA
my pre algebra binder from 6th is perfectly intact and useless
my mom really said i can't burn anything b/c i have a younger sibling
and idk if i could sell them cus they're marked n all BAHAH
oh truee
ew sat act
i only took the act once yall and never the sat
i studied for the sat for a few months and took it
i got like a 25💀
same
The ACT book holds up my monitor
but randomly decided to sign up for the act after and no regrets ahahaha
good use!
oof
that is hilarious
i would hate seeing that every day
i was so bad at the act math it wasn't even funny
give me 19 random numbers that are preferably 1-10
wake up and reminded of standardized testing
ha ha I never got to take the sat or act
can there be repeats???
I signed up for it 7 times
and they all didnt work out cause Covid
7 miss ma'am---
oh-
okay but fr
yeah my act score was useless
i had to take my last one at a hotel near sfo
i was salty tbh lOL
i took the act pre-covid
omg same
like feb 2020 lmfao
so a month before lol
yeahh i surprisingly did it early lol dec 2019
yall the way i was so stressed abt taking the act and sat when covid hit just for the uc's to waive them LMAOOOO
I didnt because I wanted to study the most I could xD
like that was fr the best news i've ever received
my school offered a practice test in sept or oct and it was soo spontaneous but i actually liked the act so much better from that one practice
4 2 3 6 7 9 4 8 6 4 2 3 9 1 7 9 2 5
to think i wouldve stuck w my crappy sat score ahahah
i tried to count them zoe
i did the psat and i think i got like a 1210
or 1250 idk HAHAHA
Thanks 😄
my psat was higher than my sat which is stupid bc psat has a lower max as well lmao
xD
psat is superior lowk lol
act >>>>>>
LOL
i just rly liked the science section which everyone hate oops
and reading was a lot easier than sat reading for me
omg the act had me nervous
like that mf was intimidating for junior year me
i already forgot how it was for me tbh
i was manifesting a 36 for days before LMAO
omg FELT HAHA
ik my score wouldn't be too good the first time cus i didn't study lol
lmaoooo i honestly stopped caring once the test was over
once it's done it's done yk
i didnt expect to do well bc i always got <<< for reading and it was dragging it down so much
yepp
i remember people being stessed during covid
most ppl still tried to sign up even tho they all got cancelled
i was one of them🥲
its ok it didnt matter 😌
i see 2022/23 people taking it now and im like- i thought they didnt care lmaoo
i thought they were gonna stop it
i think uc's are stopping it
ooh okay
but i guess i forgot that some people wanna go to ivies and all that
true true
i be forgetting about the privates
sameee
i didnt care about the privs i applied to bc my parenst wouldnt allow me out of state anyways
i just didn't wanna go out of state cus it's ✨ expensive✨
^^^
also i didnt have strong feelings so didnt thik it was worth it anyway
same
ucsd is also so much cooler
lmaooooooooooo true
ucsd actually stands for University of California So DCool
i spent a whole five minutes thinking of a word that starts with d
and the only thing my tired brain came up with was divine
okay but ME
ahahaha
is anyone going to dress up for the closing ceremony today?
um i don’t really have an eye mask😭
yes 😡
i mean it also says spooky attire
Yessir!
oooh that sounds fun!! i'll look forward to that then lmao
i don't think i ever did a spooky halloween costume
I have a mask
but idk how spooky it is
and its kinda fragile
i have old masks but they're dusty
i have my old halloween costume sitting next to me
wait zoe, if you don't wear it, i wanna see a pictureeeeeeeeee
Ill wear it for a little then or just hold it up
yayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
i already put on half of my costume for fun since no one will be able to see it as long as my background is on lmao
ooh i wanna see it
right??? zoe's mask is probably super cool!!!
i dont have a mask so im just using one of the zoom fake ones aahaha
ohhhh that seems cool!!! :3

ooo you should teach us how to cook whatever you make 😩
Ha ha
Mushroom chicken maybe?
I’m feeling kinda lazy
felt
We had Mexican food yesterday so maybe not Mexican
oh is mushroom chicken really easy then?

We could have salad with it

Do I need to show you guys how to do it XD
LOL if you wanna i'd watch
Imma start the rice in a rice cooker cause that’s not like
Hard?
rice cookers are the bestttttttt
Yeah sure let me grab headphones

oh i might cause i can make other stuff with it
but idk
Idk cause some aren’t allowed
that's something my mom will tell me lmao
oh yeah i know they said microwaves/fridges were allowed but i wasnt sure about other specific appliances
i was thinking about bringing one but i keep telling myself i need to spend my dining dollars
I’ll find it for you
tbh i'm not going to worry too much about it
it has to be a certain watt i believe
i don't think i will be cooking much anywayyyyyyyyy

@Gary Gillespie
@Curt
lmao zoe, out of context this is all quite confusing :3
ahhhhhhhhhhhhh i knew it was stupid to start watching outlast, especially a no commentary version
how's saturday going for everyone?
i somehow managed to understand recursion sm better😭
dead dk how but 😭😭😭
that's wonderful alexxxxxxxxxxxxx :3
it was like crazy lowk
I got to hang out with Rena in person!

Yeah!!!
I’m happy
It was a nice Saturday
Wowww
omg y’all are so cute!!
the food looks amazing too :oo where did you guys go?
We went to UTC https://thegreatmaple.com/la-jolla/ Great Maple.
It's pretty nice, a bit expensive though.
oh!! i’ve been meaning to try there
that’s near the entrance to the large parking garage yea?
Yes!
The maple donuts are yummy
oooooo
i just noticed something really weird on the poll, it's logging 6️⃣ twice as a reaction
Okay then fix it
Jk lmao
@mentor--Josh
lmao diego, i wasn't even on here for the last hour
i think it just means the other person used a diff version of the 6 emoji lol
also hi and bye guys hehe
hiiii
gm friends
Gm same
Sam
hi ethan
how has your morning been?
Uneventful
Been trying to sleep bc my mom wants me to wake up early to practice the dmv routes
you should
do that then!
Brain poo poo
I’m only tired when I pick up my phone
then stop picking up ur phone silly
You pinged my mentees instead of me 😭
It worked 😊
A bit expensive? That was the most expensive breakfast out I’ve ever had when I went with my friend a couple months ago
But it was REALLY GOOD
jenny, i checked though
Ha ha I don’t go out to eat too often
So everything seems expensive to me
I’m missing APS homework help again
It ends as my shift ends
https://tenor.com/view/crying-cry-rabbit-cute-adorable-gif-14580378
awwwwww
i’m just skipping it lmao
I wish I didn’t have to skip it
https://tenor.com/view/mochi-peachcat-mochi-peachcat-hug-pat-gif-19092449
there's a valorant tournament happening soon-ish 
o yes thats strange then hmmm
also i was out all day yesterday and today so i gotta start APS ahhh
lmaooo i gotta do aps as well ahahah
i just looked at it again and i took notes from niema's lectures but now i cant understand what i was saying i-
i think im too tired
maybe take a small nap and then go back to it
i was going to! but my mom just told me to stick with it til i finish my stuff and sleep early...
we all know that even if im tired, sleeping early fails LOL
y e s
even melatonin can't win against my will sometimes ahahah
okay but my mom too
they jsut wanna fix our wacky sleep but it doesnt work </3
ahahahah
if i can force myself to not sleep after getting my covid shot, i think it's gonna take a lot more work to get me to sleep normally
technically, i *could* wake up early and it would be much better for me than staying up late (i've tried both)
plus it's cold in the morning often
exactly and tbh i dont get why waking up early is better? my dad said smth about inner clock and getting the sunlight but ehh i just pretend im in another country
o gosh i slept all day after second dose lol my head was dying in stats class so i crashed after
it has to do with circadian rythm i think, but i'd argue that even if it's better to wake up early, it's also much more important to get a full night's sleep lol
darn it there's a legit reason lol but yeah thats why i sleep in whenever i can instead of forcing myself to wake up early on weekends hehe
ahahah i was supposed to be good at bio :3
but i also ignored most of the things i learned from bio
by much better for me, i just mean that i can get the same things done that i do at like 12am but with less trouble
so if i really wanted to do things "properly" i should go to bed early and wake up at like 5 to 6 am
oh thats so interesting lol
for me, i just know that im more productive the closer it is to the deadline, but sometimes waking up early is a gamle (i might snooze too much)
i did not learn in ap bio at all this year uhh the senioritis hit hard :))
same ahahahahah 
i didn't pay attention once things went online in spring 2020 ahahahah
i took human anatomy then and then cell bio
exactly i feel like its such a waste of time if i try to start early and do nothing lolll
o gosh same here idk why i did better on ap stuff senior year tho
yeah i dont even remember anything that isnt 7th grade science level
ahahahaha i felt that
i'm so glad no more science classes for me ahahah
crazy that youre in revelle but no more science 😩
well i magically finished my science reqs
@jennosaur♡  look at this
that is literally so cute and relatable
r i g h t?
aaaaaaa
they should really put that on the error 404 ahahah
a c at
honestly i should do aps but watching ethan fight lady dimitrescuuuuuuu
ikr would make errors more enjoyable
lmaoo ive been looking at classes again because im just confused about locations
fun fact mosiac is such a wonky name that google maps doesn't recognize
but gary did say that you can leave classes early to get to the next one
you know ive been looking at mosaic for this past while
ive been trying to figure out how much i have to run to get to wlh lol
i guess that makes sense but some of these new sixth buildings are annoying because i dont know the campus enough to choose something near it if it doesnt pop up lmao
yeah they really are
the placement is also weird
some classes have discussion afterwards and then the discussion is a whole 16 minutes away
as if that was logical
ikr... i didnt realize discussions were kinda optional but i was trying to plan around that
i keep switching up my schedule that by the time enrollment happens, ill probably just be confsued
wait they are??? i thought they weren't aaaaaaa
i dont even know anymore
i think its still a very good idea to show up
maybe its like how lectures are "optional" but you should go lol
well ofc but if it's not mandatory 👀
i won't have to stress myself as much over time conflicts if they aren't ahahah
hmm i just searched and it seems like it depends on class/prof
so
may be not rly useful until you go
reddit recommends to email the prof if you wanna know before the syllabus is out lol
a r g h
okay
not bad
welp after all that now im in the mood for ramen and i may go eat some *hopefully aps doesnt take me too long bc i wrote bullet points so far*
lmaooo aps
i just type giant paragraphs as fast as i can
but it definitely shouldn't take too long since there are only four actual problems
then i have to redo my four year plan again before i finish watching outlast 2
on a far less related note, how's sunday going for everyone?
exactly thats why im procrastinating :0kittyheadbang: even tho i tell myself not to
tbh im only planning by quarter because everything would go haywire if i didnt get one class i needed and i'd have to redo the plan anyways
and my day's been good but also bittersweet, had a sleepover with some of my friends who are leaving in a few days so we basically said our goodbyes today :(
wbu?
I tried sushi omakase for the first time 😃
earlier today (as in like 12 am) i finished watching outlast whistleblower so that was nice but also absolutely terrifying ahahah
how was it, ethan?
Fantastic
that's goood :3
Super pricey, but definitely worth it
oo i dont even know specifically what that is, is it raw fish still?
The fatty tuna and wagyu were the standouts tho
Yessss really good cuts of raw fish
is that horror 😩 i watched the notbook yesterday but tbh i was just really done with the characters for the most part LOL oops
i think omakase is like chef's pick if i remember right
idk it came up in animal crossing
Yea chefs choice is the direct translation I believe
sounds fancy!
It was
I went to this tiny little place in an alleyway
lmfaooo i swear every drama has that moment
And it had a cute ambience
oooh that sounds cool
i'd wanna search it but i dont even like sushi lmaoo
You WHAT
👀 raw fish texture just isnt it
Mmm that’s fair
oh i don't eat raw fish but for a different reason
I only got into eating raw fish after I had this bomb ass poke bowl in Hawaii
also i feel like the notebook is such a classic but i swear the non-consent and the cheating just made me roll my eyse so much
ive only tried a tiny bite of my friend's once but ehh fish also isnt my fav
i thought too hard about disney movies and now i ruined it for myself ahah
same i don't really like fish that much
i remember watching this tv show where people got parasites from eating raw fish
since then, i have never even considered raw fish worth the risk to eat
Honestly fish still isn’t my go to, but now I just like eating if it’s like specifically good
ahhh yeah everyone says not to think of movies logically but if it's supposed to be about life, i'll be pretty cynical haha
oh yeah thats also sketchy but if you go to somewhere where the stuff is prepped safely it should be alright
im wondering how bistro(?) sushi is tho... maybe i;ll try again if i really need to use dining dollars
I got the pricier one, I’ll treat you if I have leftovers come the end of the quarter
lmaooo ethan
honestly at this point i feel like making sushi would be cheaper than buying it
but also can't drive
I sure as hell ain’t eating raw fish anywhere that doesn’t have a stellar reputation
Mood 😔
The price usually comes from having to source it from places that are like
Across the world, right
idk from what i remember it costs my mom less to go to mitsuwa to buy fish there and make sushi over going to a restaurant
i have the cheap one but it's literally $30 every weekday... and i assume ill use around 5-10 a day so i dont know what ill do LOL
and yeah it's probably bad to be stingy with raw foods hahaha
Yeaaa I was gonna say
Not sure how much I would trust grocery store raw food
lmao
the only "sushi" i like is litearlly rice and seaweed
maybe a bit of the furikake seasoning or wtv
kappa sushi is p chill
not even california rolls ???
or the inari sushi
wait what about the ones with fish roe like the tobiko and stuff
inari is so good
it is until you have too many
battleshup sushi?
what?
idk any of these other ones but california rolls are ok if i pick it apart and eat the parts separately LMAO ik that isnt the point but i dont like mixing stuff
bistro is actually really good. probably the most refined dining food on campus. falls a little flat of off campus sushi like Kura, but much better than gas station type sushi
forgot the actual name
lmaooooooo
but is it as bad as sfo sushi
bc that shit was
maybe i'll go there sometime hmm
traumatizingly bad
i know i can splurge on food but i just dont know what i'll want
i don't usually trust airport food ngl
theres some good airport food
LOL isnt airport food always bad
oh
theres a nice burger place at sfo
didnt know that
same
but i also haven't been traveling
that too
usually i go to the san jose airport tbh
i did travel last month but im usually half asleep or nauseous when i go to the airport so i dont pay attention
ah i havent been there in so long
i like airplanes for whatever reason but i also usually never sleep on them ahahahah
i only sleep on them
i used to throw up 100% of the time on airplanes til late elem school years
awwwww i'm glad that's no longer the case
honestly when the plane is leaving the ground and landing are my least favorite parts
it's like riding a rollercoaster tbh
im glad too i hated it sm lol
oh yeah those are so rocky and noisy
i dont like it but i like rollercoasters :3
ahahah i'm so bad with rollercoasters because i don't scream, i just have an apparently very terrified expression as i cling to the friend next to me for dear life
but i get on them anyway
ahh i dont rly scream but if something unexpected happens, i squeak LOL no one can hear anyways over the actual screaming
im apparently an adrenaline junkie so makes sense that i like it hehe
i'm just really quiet but clinging like a drowned cat
also im gonna get off discord rn to focus on aps so uhh the next time i talk here i'd better be done lmao
okayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy :3
hehe drowned cat idk what that looks like
umm spis sushi making party when 👀 we can invade someone’s housing that has a kitchen
excellent idea
make sushi and pizza at the same time
y e s
pretty much just questioning its existence lmao
a novelty!
lmaoooo
i dont know how to feel about this
lmao
at least it's all sushi ingredients
i've also seen a recipe for a sushi cake actually
minus the cheese and pepperoni part xD
it doesn't look like cheese ?
i think the second one is cheese lol
i don't think so, the texture just looks off for cheese lmao
actually yeah ur right lemme see if i can find the recipe
it almost looks like how imitation crab looks but it's def not imitation crab
oml i just remembered i need to finish transferring recipes i-
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa i was supposed to do that this summer
https://www.pokeburri.com/menu-gallery
welp here's the restaurant menu if anyone wants to look at sushi fusions
no matter what it is it look delicious
the bottom one looks like ramen lmaooo
transfer recipes?
yeah i had some recipes on nyt that i want a permanent copy of
i have like 100 pages of recipes from cookbooks and stuff
it's honestly really soothing typing recipes
that sounds like a fun webscraping project lol
idk i also like spending time looking through recipes and the comments
sounds like reddit but with cooking and recipes xD
yeah most of the comments are either saying what to change to the existing recipe or that it works or that it's a massive fail
quite helpful ngl
but usually when i have to type recipes it's because it's a physical book
o makes sense
welp glhf
could scan the pages and digitally mark them up?
but that makes it less funnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
i like typing it
plus i have a specific formatting thing that i've been doing
ahahah
yall excited for move-in day when it comes?

Let’s gooooo @Viridion
Ethan on the streets now 🥶🥶
Gonna roll up to the SPIS meet up with my blue Razor
that's niceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
@Cinnamon Bun i understand how you feel now having to push things back b/c of precalc
Ha ha ha ha
Me
You taking 4 C when?
We can be together!????
i have to take 20A-E and then 18 and then 180A at the moment
Aww
but i did ask in a different server if it's absolutely necessary
i would like to just take 20A, 20B, and 18 in the ideal situation
Yeahhh
It’s hard
honestly this is exactly why the cognitive science 118 courses are going to be the death of me
oh no please
hi alexxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
hiiiii haha
im doing some karaoke rn lol
o wow
that sounds intense
math
oh that sounds nice alexxxxxxxxxx
yessir
ooo
hi lydiaaaaaaaaaaaaa
hellooooo
actually is anyone else cognitive science and planning to specialize in ml?
bro im just like 😃
i am genuinely curious as to how everyone else is going to handle the cogs 118 stuff
we just gonna handle it
the 118 reqs are weird
like grad reqs don't say you have to take that much math
but then you still do?
wack fr fr
i'm really trying not to look at my four year plan rn ahahahah
same
hi jennyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
i was, until i saw the math reqs :') thats why i wanted to do d&i instead lolll
helloo!!
smart smart
i didn't want to replan so my backup plan is if i cannot pawsibly convince the professors for 118B and 118D to let me take two less math classes, is probably going to either be changing specializations or just getting my b.s. with no specialization
ooh fr fr
ah wait i assume you would probably be done in less than 3 years if you didn't do machine learning
the only reason i even need math 20e & 180A is for that one req for the two mandatory cogsci 118A/B/C/D courses
maybe? idk i planned in a potential cs minor when i was doing it
oh yeah i saw it and i just didnt want to relearn calculus to take cde and 180a
mhm thats why i might try for a minor instead of doing ml
no extra math!
but now my seven or more math classes will probably be keeping me stressed and occupied ahahah
i mean i saw that cs majors also have a bunch of math
but i also feel like a lot of them got more math waived than i did
they do, but the minor doesnt seem to require it
i literally just have calc 10a waived
LOVE THAT
at least if you dont take upper div classes that req it
exactly 😩 i guess it depends on if you want more cs classes or a mixture of cs and math tho lol
same with the minor
i'm going to assume i can graduate in 4 years since ucsd did admit me and all
same HAHAH
but still i'm giving them my squintiest of squinty eyes
i swear it's so convenient having that minor and doing the ml specialization
you have a lot of credits and people with none can usually still grad in 4 years if they work hard enough
imagine if i have to take math over summer
i will cry
no cus fr lmaooo
if everything works out nicely then it would be so easy to complete the minor ahahah
but how are they doing it is the real question. like what if they're doing full loads every quarter including summer -0-
oh my that seems way too much... i assume that'd only happen if they cant get the classes they need multiple times and end up taking other stuff
i mean next summer i have to take spanish so i don't have to take it during the year
i have to take around seven math classes
plus everything else
ugh the cs classes will be brutal to try to get into i assume (for the minor)
afjfbfafai good luck
maybe? idk
i won't worry too much about that
best case scenario i only have one more MATH course (but there are still cs/cogs courses about math im nto counting)
i'm more concerned about graduating in four years ahahahah
niceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
im sure you can do it you have so many credits!
a lot of my credits are general elective credits so they count for nothing that i'm aware of lmfao
for me, best case scenario right now i could grad in 3 years if i wanted to (4 per quarter no summer) but i also dont want to rush college
ohh
well enrollment will be good for you :3
i have 32 units of electives that aren't upper division
wait are your other units upper div? or fulfilling GEs
they're mainly ges
i remember you had a pretty high number of units so that actually seems like a lot fulfilling ge's
yeah i have like three left
but i'm freaked out over all the lower division reqs i have before i can take some of my upper division courses
oh wait aerin are you in revelle yeah
yes i ammmmmmmmmmm
ooh okay
youre actually really ahead then! even with those math classes i would assume you can grad in 4 years
ahahaha i hope so
which college are you in?
marshall
ohhhh niceeeeeee
ayy we're kinda neighbors lol
ganggg
is anyone else having a hard time finding "fun" classes?
history is mine lmaooo
i'm slowly going through the entire course catalog trying to find something
cus i like history
honestly that does sound fun, except i get the feeling there would be some papers involved
oo
im not really planning on doing any fun ones tbh
hi again lydia!!!
i keep forgetting abt writing essays
hiii lydia
LOL hii sorry im going in and out hahah
i am so scared of actually having the fun ones displace my lower division reqs
^ exactly im too scared of using up a space
hild is part of my ge lmfaooo
if i cant get into my classes tomorrow, i have some "fun" ones that would count for ge's but i dont really want to use them lol
don't be too stressed about getting into classes! it's only your first quarter and i PROMISE there's time!
i know it's stressful, my first quarter i wanted to plan absolutely everything, but don't worry about it, trust me!
im having trouble making my mind for GEs bc i wanna do so many but they arent in the same "theme" for muir T_T
just remember the CSE priority system (i.e. the waitlist/ enroll count won't be accurate) and try to get to what you can!
ahh icic ty for the advice
hi joshhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
hello
also that is nice advice
i only planned this quarter so far but i dont know what to expect during enrollment lol
ill brb really quick need to see if i can steal a parking spot xD
LOL
gl lmaoo
^^^
gg lmaooo
yeh same im just looking at the 4 year plan but who knows whatll happen
i'm planning four years, hence my panic
i have to redo my four year plan
plans could change!! i feel like you dont need to go so far ahead
o how come
rn i just have my checklist done with all the courses and backups
yea they def will change!
interests rn may not be the same in a year
well for one thing, parents
but i do feel somewhat secure with a schedule made lolol
ahh ic
so it's just best i have the idea of what i can/should do
relatable
yea fs
esp cause my goal is to keep my major and not change it lmaooo
sameee
sameeeeee
true i defintiely dont wanna change
but theres a lot of freedom when it comes to uppe div electives so i'll probably only look at those starting next eyar
pretty much once i finish planning, it'll be past the point of no return
ik ppl keep telling me that i can and its ok to change bc a lot of ppl change but i jsut feel like i wouldnt be able to graduate bruh LOL
some of them are so nice
LOOL
same
their only req is upper div standing
exactlyyy
YEAH esp sice im planning on taking 2 lower div cogs first quarter (bc i cant come up w other classes lol) so it seems like a waste since it fulfils nothig else
i'm really indecisive so i'm just going to stick with my major and tough it out ahahah
im too indecisive i wouldnt get anywhere if i tried to find smth i liked
ahhhh icic
also like psych has so many ud courses that are cog sci approved electives with no or almost no prereqs
burhhr im so indecisive T_T i cant even choose my GEs for the future quarters
hi zoeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
You guys could take music or art classes
oh yesss im def taking music
i don't remember how to read notes
YES a lot of the psc ones seem fun
Or like a fun interesting class
mus 8
jazz
Then you don’t need to throw yourself into it
eee
i'm literally going through the course catalog to find things
i wanna do dance for fine arts but i want to wait for upper div :)
Isn’t that one full rn?
but the music classes get filled SO QUICKLY
yeaa its filled
Yeah I know
I hope Mus 12 doesn’t fill
im not even attempting for first quarter
oo is that the opera one?
I’m praying for opera
it seems like so many are full always
Yessss
yeeeee
they all seem so interesting
i thought opera wasnt offered this quarter>?
i hope both of you get the music classes y'all want :3
It is!
i'm probably gonna do the fine arts next quarter lol
yeaa same
I’m gonna do opera this quarter hopefully
cus history is calling my name HAHAH
this quarter its just  math cs and muir writing
Cause I wanna have Gunn
danggg
ooh good luck 🤞
history
Imagine normal history LOL
i've been thinking, maybe skip the whole fun classes entirely and just do all my lower division reqs
history is my least fav omg i wish i could like it more
i just have to take one more history class to fulfill ges but idk which one ahh
https://tenor.com/view/anime-no-dont-no-way-gif-14108770
same
thats what i was gonna do :3
me feeling weirdly excited about revelle's humanities sequence
Update there were no spots open
ahahahah
You have to take fun classes
the course descriptions all seem so interesting but then i check reddit ahsduoh
my "history" classes are the 5 quarter of mmw ugh lol
Or you’re gonna die
im excited for doc fr
In mus 12?
THERES NONE?
i think parking
Parking spots xD
i thought parking
LOL
https://tenor.com/view/anime-umaru-cry-crying-tears-gif-5184314
LOL
HAHAHA
OH MY GOD
lmaooooooooo
YOURE CAUSING ME
STRESS
JOSH
LOOOLLL
ahahaha
YOU BETTAYED ME
betrayed^
oop
ahahah
I’m crying bro
The stress
omg noooo
there are currently 43 spots for opera
zoeeeeeeee are you going to take hum 2 when it's available in spring?
das a lot
whens ur enrollment time
https://tenor.com/view/food-chocolate-melt-fork-anime-gif-17093939
I feel like this
omo
1:00
that looks yum
oo nice
i felt that too
you can keep checking webreg
today i checked and found one class i planned full and was like :') time to find another
I’m gonna take Hum 1 in winter Hum 2 in Spring Hum 3 next falls then 4 and 5 at community college
ME TOO
i wish mine was a little earlier but ik ppl have later times than me so i should be thankful lolsodla
wow lots of hum
i thought you could only transfer 1 hum course?
i only got 1 waived
so i still have to take 4 or 5
You only have to do 1-3 on campus
i got my breadth ld waived i believe
And then 4-5 you can take off campus
i-
do you know if they "refill" spots? or reserve some for later times? it seems dumb if it's all the same
you know what
hum can be my fun class
uhhhh
if hum is fun for you thats great LOL
Hum is probably gonna be fun
it's probably the only humanities i will be taking ahahah
I’m excited for it
I like writing and reading
And I’m excited for the Greek unit
i dont know much about it i just assumed the required writing sequences were gonna be annoying but maybe thas bc im in erc
i'm just banking on knowing some stuff from whap
i dont think so
not sure
WHAP?
ap world history
No one calls it Whap at my school
We call it AP World
whap
thats kinda strange if they dont but i dont know how anything works
That’s fricken weird
that sounds so weird LOL
oh i say ap world but type whap lmaooo
yeah cause they slap you with a bunch of info
yeah same
interesting
it's faster to type whap
LOL
pronounced like wap :')

https://tenor.com/view/hmm-thinking-hanako-anime-yashiro-gif-16377462
thats what i thought of at first

Ooh target is great
ahahaa
i was imagining whack
broo i love how targets on campus
oml same
I got like a hanging thing for shoes and a tote bag and shower caddy and a bunch of stuff tonight from target
oo
But I need to find XL sheets
oh that's niceeeeeee
i saw a shower caddy the other day but it was so tiny i decided against it
oh those were a total pain to find
but it was so cute T_T
aw :(
the sheets
still buying dorm things tho
SAME
I have this super cute like comforter I found
i only have sheets bc im using my sisters
i haven't packed anything i-
samE

It’s pink gold and white and black polka dots!!!
ooooh
ohhh cuteeeeeeeeee
i didnt realize i need boxes and suitcases brurhurhrur
hi again joshhhhh
I was going to but the texture is funky on my skin because it’s not 100% cotton
theres a target on campus (plus the bookstore) and some other stores near campus, so don't worry if you forget something! you can pick it up while down here
sameee LMAOOO
there are literally piles of stuff in my room
SAME
i have target and homegoods bags everywehre LOOL
I have the quarantine corner next to my balcony door
All the college stuff sits there
i just have this pile of stuff for college and half of the items are kinda getting dusty
oh yes quarantining your supplies
MOOD
idek when im gonna start getting stuff
i have like five books
A lot of stuff is on sale run cause of school
im just gonna get when i get it
But I don’t know if like
The sales will go away
But it’s apparent stores are running out of some stuff rn
idk what supplies to get
its been so long since i bough school supplies
I made a list of stuff I wanted to get
idk what i need anymore LOL
ohhhh that's smart
i only know dorm supplies but not actual school stuff
Yeah for my dorm room and school supplies
i just used a list i found from the c'o 2025 discord
Ooh
For dorm or for school supplies
yeaa same i made a list for dorm but idk abt school
both
apparently
I only thought like pens high lighter pencil computer notepad
ngl my parents are making most of the executive decisions on what i'm bringing and buying lmao
loollll
What more do I need for school supplies
i saw calculators
o yah where yall from :0?
i was planning on using my laptop for everything so idont even know
san joseeeeeeeee
Oof you right
temecula
sunnyvale
if you're taking more math, you need calculators
ooo
graphing and maybe scientific was what the list i was looking at said
but the type depends on the class
ah i cant even find my scientific one anymore oops
i hope none of the maths i have to take need a scientific calculator
i gave mine to my brother and i don't trust it now that he's used it for a couple of years
I have a graphing one I think
ngl
Or my sister stole it
im just gonna wing my dorm move in
LOL
lowk samee
That’s okay
It’ll be okay
i'm going to wing my first quarter
if i forget anything i can come home n get it
all of us
lucky you ahahah
I’m trying not to sing it but I feel like I’m singing it
oh yeah you can do that :')
Wing* not sing
my parents will be mailing whatever i forget over ahahah
So stressful
okay but of all the people i know who are in college
tbh i dont even know how mailing works in dorms lol
i live around 2 hrs away so i can go home over the weekend or smth to get some stuff LOL
i have yet to hear of one dying of stress
so maybe it'll be okay
idk how anything works rn T_T
i think i kinda know but it's okay cause google and upperclassmen
o gosh
remember not to only do school all day every day!
if anything it seems like everyone's having fun???
i'll have to remember to do school
it's so easy for me to not do school
my sister literally told me she was so bored in college because it was easier than hs for her (but that was bc of her major/school lol)
wait what major???
i just get scared seeing the 10+ hours of work for all the cs classes ahahah
uhhh
liberal studies or something lol she's a teacher
ohhhhhhh
that's niceeeeeeee
yep and when i was being indecisive i was like what if i just follow her footsteps ahahaha
but i dont think i have the patience
ohhh that's kinda cool lmao
previously i thought maybe architecture
i took one look at the application which ofc asked for a portfolio and was like "okay what's another major i can do"
omg yeah the designy art ones always have portfolio reqs that make me go o.o
honestly i kinda think the design specialization would be fun
but also
I’m looking for my graphing calculator
I can’t find it anywhere
oh my
zoe do you remember the last time you used it?
aerin you were typing so long where'd it go LOL
Some point during the school year
so it's still soemwhere around your house for sure right?
i couldn’t figure out how to say it
Not really my sister may have it
She liked to borrow it
ah welp hopefulyl she knows where it is
mood
i dont know a thing about design and im not creative
but i know its a popular specialization lolll
tbh the clinical one sounds more interesting to me but i dont know what id use it for
I’m just confused because I know I wouldn’t move it out of my room and I can’t find it xD
i think the best way to put it is that design specialization usually ends with people in the ux/ui design field as far as i’m aware
I’d like to think I’m organized …
but i don’t know how that fits with what i wanna do after i graduate
This is a problem for me later
i say this to myself too
XD
i felt that zoe
wait are all y’all cogs
yeahhh i have no idea if i'd be interested in uiux (i dnt rly think i am so...)
jenny, alex h, and i are
Take classes you’re interested in !
That will make you like them!
i say i have disorganized messes!
And then it will be easier to wanna do stuff
wow cogsci represent
Data science
https://tenor.com/view/disco-dog-dance-gif-13752673
sam are you also cog sci?
thats true but im indecisive and have no interests so might as well do something more uselful ahahha
She’s computer science major
ohhhhh
Or explore!
Look at classes that sound cool then take those
Like for data science upper division there’s tons of clssses so I looked through them all and circled the ones I liked
oh no
tbh some of the psych ones might be interesting to me but im not sure about any of the jobs
im math-cs lol
Then I know which ones I wanna do
mathematics dept swag
and some education ones bc i like kids but i also dont want to acutally be a teacher LOL
@ragdoll kitten I lied to you
math queeens
I feel that
it’s okay zoe :3
it was quite close lmaooo
i was thinking it was a cs one but i couldt remember oops
I’m so stressed about classes
I like asked John 10 billion questions today
you know what i wanna know? how much fun do disney imagineers have?
okay but zoe, good job
cause if that helps you feel better
I feel so bad for him though cause I’m dense
it’s for a good cause
I’m A ROCK
He had to like point exactly where it was
that happens to me too much its ok
same
If I was a rock
I hope I’m nice rock
Like smooth
johns a sweetheart go john
lmao
you’d be a very pretty and nice rock
smooth rock smooth brain
Smoooth brain
my brain is liquid slush
no winkle 💅
:CB_smoothbrain:
lmaooo jenny
The coding
Make me wanna die a little inside
Sam tried to help me
But I feel like
DUMB
oh which lab are you on?
Lab 5
ohhhhhhh
The re-sizing step
ohhh we had problems with that
turns out we messed up
not really messed up
i feel like im doin everything wrong sighh
we missed something lmao
We got this:
jenny aren't you and your lab partner on lab 6 though
*well i dont exactly know whats happening most of the time shhh*
wait how do you have two images?
ID LIKE TO ASK THE SAME THING
you should only have one?
But I think it’s because
We took the pixels every other one
Like the directions said
wait what
And put it in a smaller area
ohhh the resizing one is strange that way
But the remaining pixels
Just stayed
thats why you need to use the Image.new thingy
But WE DIDNT
so
https://tenor.com/view/batman-derp-tongue-out-gif-8169679
you're supposed to i think?
Yeah
We just got excited cause we drafted out a plan
ohhh lmaooo
That’s why Sam was trying to help us
one of our versions just made the rest of the picture black so it was still 600x800 but only the top left showed...
well dw you have this week to get it done
See then I was like
What if we painted the rest
BLACK
ours looked 600 x 800 despite the fact it wasn't
my partner did that and i was like ...
XD
oh yeah it just looks blurrier
one of our versions is literally that LOL
we just left it as that
and we moved on
i think no matter the image size, it displays the same way
thats why its blurrierer
i finally understand why people say the pixels matter in pictures or wtv now tho
I always knew cause I did photoshop since middle school
wait what do you mean by that jenny?
So like pixels are important and bigger the better
my brain is buffering hard
I just realized I haven’t prepared for my opera lesson today (since it’s morning) at 5:30
i mean its like looking at a picture, then a pic with smaller dimensions but zoomed in
I’m gonna cry
they show up as the same size but blurrier
Maybe i should cancel it?
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa good luck
5:30?????
oh wait
ohhhhhhhhh
pm
Yeah
do you need to prep a lot?
I might ask her if we can cancel this week because I need a break
I need to learn French pronunciation for a piece and be familiar with two Italian pieces
I haven’t even looked at them
yeah dont overwhelm yourself... if you really need to practice maybe you could use lunch break or something
oh my
oh wow that's a lot
did u get it working ;-;
After SPIS I just sleep
N o p e xD
mood
Like I’m exhausted
samee
i took uhhh 3-4 naps today oopsies
okay but my brother just started learning to use photoshop and i've just been dead inside
So maybe I can ask her to take the day off ?
Then I do a lesson next week
And give myself time to actually learn the stuff
ye s
that sounds like a good idea
^^^
She’s gonna be so sad though xD
I feel so guilty xD
But my health!
i'm sure your teacher will understand though
Yeah, she’s knows I’m busy. It’s just last weeks lesson I was so tired I thought I was gonna collapse.
actually i just realized i don't think i've seen an art history course yet ahahahah
zoe, maybe a break would be good
cause it sounds like you need one
Singing is hard ;-;
perhaps you could ask to rescheudle
I don’t have time unfortunately, it would have to be after spis or during lunch time…
I work on the weekends
And we have sois all day
I want to leave option for lab hours open cause I’m a dumb dumb
So I might just have to meet up with her next week
ohh well im sure that taking a break to get rest and learn stuff is better than forcing yourself to go to one unprepared anyways!
That’s true!
I will try to be optimistic
I’ll let her know in the morning so she can relax and doesn’t question me xD
I just realized I need to do APS homework
ahahah dont send that midnight text
https://tenor.com/view/gochiusa-anime-despair-smile-gif-20042392
*or message
wait isnt aps due sunday
yeah aps is due sunday lmao
I know but I don’t have time over the weekend cause I work 6 hours and into APS time. So I have to do it during lunch, but not tomorrow’s lunch because of the mentor lunch
So I’ll do it after SPIS tomorrow
Then continue it lunch Thursday
o
Hopefully be done by Friday and then turn it in
send the midnight text
Or wait today not tomorrow
NO MIDNIGHT TEXTS
we have another aps class on thurs so you could probably refine it and finish up thurs lunch !!
midnight texts <3333
https://tenor.com/view/life-sad-anime-alone-gif-16249499
how long is this weeks aps
I wish the lectures were spaced out a bit more
I don’t know I haven’t even looked
The 15 minute break isn’t enough to recharge my batteries
frrr
I feel like I don’t listen as well in the second lecture
i cannot focus for my life
its so bad
T_T
i kinda wish it was one lecture before lunch one after
idk WHAT TO DO
I’m so good during the first then the second I get sleepy
sameee
Yes!
and lab hrs or smth in btwn to recharge??
yes
i cant even name what we learned except pygame today 😭
I take notes to stay awake but if I get sleepy I can tune stuff out and stare into space
Then I come back and get confused
i only focused 100% during aps
XD
Even the end of APS I was struggling
ngl i got a bit lost in one of the later sorting ones
lmao jenny
you just named something other than pygame that we learned
sorting
then i went in and out of pygame
ahh
i only remember bubble sort but i dont think he taught that in class
I know all about the sorting
wait
But PYGAME
I got so lost
that was today?? LOL
same
LOOOL WTH
pygame feels like scratch
but harder
im so confuesd my brainnn
yeah
i'm honestly just learning from the labs
reminds me of when i did scratch for fun in elem school ahahah
idk what happened in pygame
same
i feel like doing it is easier than actually learning it from lecture
The labs are nice snd I like how they introduce the concept snd show you the fundamentals
i think i "focused" better in that one bc i was actually trying to type the code he was showing so i had to not space out
yeaa it is bc my attention span is worse than a goldfish
The lectures are nice
also i should move around the house instead of being in one place all day
Yeah that’s true
maybe that owuld help
sameee ppl literally call me a goldfish
yeah that too
omg LOOOLL
maybe ucsd walking is good for us 😩
HAHAHA
The thing is I will type their code the same way snd then it errors
okay but i almost never move around when i'm home
frr issa workout
And I’m so confused snd trying to fix it then get so lost
mine errored so much but im just really bad at parentheses
i hate this desk position now
-0-
i finally started understanding the errors recently
been here too long
I hate my desk XD
i have ~100 steps a day so college will hurt
and since then it's been niceeeeeeeeee
LOL
oo
I stand for like 5 hours straight for work sometimes more
i can technically walk more than  100 steps a day
but i also don't want to
You get used to it
^^^^
Walking is good for you XD
i really got 70 yesterday :')
Idk how to tell how much
i used to go to art museums a lot and just outdoors stuff
i used to be able to stand for a while bc 3 hrs of choir or more and i was always fine lol
and my mom always insisted on walking for hours upon hours upon hours
so at this point it would be weird if i couldn't tolerate a lot of walking
oo
ahh i used to hike but that was like 10 years ago so ive lost all my athletic ability
This is my steps from “today”
omg my athletic ability is just missing
covid just made me feel like i didnt have to try to move at all
zoe walks more than i do in a day
vs 1256 today…
probably me in the whole week
what the heck????
lmao sam
JUST TODAY?
i have 372 steps
wowie
I can look for most steps I’ve done
i should start exercising regularly
20k is the highest i got this year
wowww
i was literally in san fran allll day
ohhhhh
omggggg
how did you get 26k -
i love sf T_T_T_T_T_T_T
dude!!! thats how i got my 27k
oh wow LOL
i think near the end my friends and i were all tired so we used buses instead
owo
This is when I went to Disneyland
yall this will be us in a month 😌
I have a funny story
o wowww
LOOL
Wanna hear it?
ucsd lessgo
ofccc
the last time i walked a bunch was august cause my friend and i were hanging out before they moved
There are two parking lots at Disneyland, the 20 dollar one and the expensive one
I parked in the tram 20 dollar one. My friends and I were at Disney all day snd then I was exausted and wanted to sleep
So they took my hand and took me to where they thought the parking lot is
These two parking lots are like a mile apart I swear
oh no
So we walk down to the expensive parking lot it takes like 20 minutes
And my friends realize it’s the wrong area!
And I was like; dragging my feet tired cause I have to drive us back to the hotel
And so my friends ask where the other parking lot is and we get told it’s on the opposite side of the park so we have to go all the way back
It’s like 11:40 PM at this point and I’m wearing this back pack so I lock it on and just make a beeline to the tram
I just ran all the way over there with my friends behind me
That’s why I think I took so many steps
But we got to the hotel at like 1 AM
jeez :((
So that was nice
I can laugh about it now XD
But at the time I was gonna pass out
wow i would probably have collapsed and given up at the wrong parking lot lmaoo
wooo exercise 🥴 but literally its too late for that
It was a 40 minute walk to the parking lot in the dark if we missed the tram
oh wowwwww
So I wanted to run and make sure we were safe and able to get back
i think the most i ever walked was around 18k steps sooo
XD
oh wait nevermind i found a record from 2017
You’ve never walked more in your life?
hello what's popping
it was 26,272
hi ethannnnnnnnnn
just "speed"ran minecraft
hi ethan gm
hey guys whens bedtime
oh shit
i have not done my arm workouts yet, i cannot sleep
Now ?  XD
i need to wake up early to mentally prepare for enrollemt
my walking history is really weird to look at sometimes it's less than 100 and other times it's in the hundreds and other times it's in the thousands
I can’t even enroll until Thursday
sigma gridnset never stops
oml sameeeeee zoe
I’m so sad
All the classes are gonna fill
not even thursday but thursday at 9pm ahahah
oh fuck i completely forgot, i enroll tmrw
Oh my god
Mine is 10:20 AM I think
thurs @ 10:20 gang
thats why i feel like they would have reserved spots for later times??? but i dont have a clue how it works 😭
Sam!!!
I love Sam
Sam is like an Angel
i love zoe
Awww
honestly i will not even worry about that lmaooo
I love you too
<3
I’m so sleepy
cute friendship :3
I’m hugging mr sprinkles

LOVELY
if i oversleep, its over
this one?
wait what time
set some really loud alarms my friend
ethan what time is yours?
Yes that one
9:20
ooo i love
But the smaller one not the smallest
you'll be in spis ethan
yes
yeah
dont oversleep
so you should be awake
how could you sleep through that i-
pog
pog indeed
lectures are at 8:45???
ethan are you late to lectures lmao
Don’t sleep through it
yea yea, but theres always a possibility of oversleeping
https://tenor.com/view/slap-bear-slap-me-you-gif-17942299
Set alarms
i haven't been late to any lectures 😭
yet.
So many alarms
im scared about tat too even though i havent overslept an 8:45 lecture yet
you know what works
siblings or parents
ive only overslept lab hours oops
I was late to lab hours by three minutes today cause I was stressed about classes
my mom sometimes will just pop in if i'm off schedule and sleeping too long
aw :((
yeah i told my mom on monday and she woke me up early yesterday bc she thought i meant tues 😭
but also now that my brother is going to school there's so much noise in the morning
I got offered a place in a special honors Revelle thing but it doesn’t fit in my schedule
cause he stomps around the house
And it freaks me out
same but i'm skipping ahah
:oo
ok bye bye, gonna work out and try to sleep
i'd rather do 16 units of stuff
I’m gonna do it in the winter, but we have to keep a 3.7 GPA
good night ethan
gnn
13 unit moment
i don't think i could really wreck my gpa that badly
I wanna be a honors fancy lady
But I’m dumb
So I might just die
honors sounds like stress
no dying >:(((
An A- = 3.7
oh really? weird
Did you know how bananas that is
https://tenor.com/view/cute-cat-crying-tears-sad-emotional-gif-15881815
thats scary
i'm not even going to worry about my gpa
i have no plans on being an honors student
i always say that lol but when i see it drop i know ill hate it
as long as i have a 3.0 i'm happy
I feel like I’ve always been an honor student so I don’t know what to do with myself
i'm not expecting myself to really be just peachy
That’s a healthy mindset
i dont expect to be because i always have a pessimistic mindset for myself
I tend to get sad when my grade goes down
but when it actualyl comes to it i still get annoyed
honestly i think the correct response is to kinda just let go of all the honor student stuff if it starts wrecking your mental health and stuff
That’s true
yes yourself is >>>>
I just find it harder to stop mental stuff than physical
Like I didn’t do AP stuff cause it physically hurt me XD
But I can’t stop the honors mentality cause my brain is reee
In short it hurts to write
honestly i think mental pain and trauma and stuff really comes back to haunt big time
My wrist is funky
I’m trying to be nice to my brain
OH yeah writing hurts lmao
which is why mental health matters!!!
Today I ate lots of chocolate cause it made me happy
that's good!!!!
yesss thats good
Yes! Chocolate for completing spis
Positive reinforcement !
mental pain/trauma lasts wayyyy longer
that's great zoe!!!
jenny fr fr
you deserve chocolate  whenever you want :3
I lost most of the muscle in my wrist and have brain stuff that messes with my wrist plus over flexibility
So writing makes me cry
;w;
XD
oh that sounds painfulll
Don’t cry it’s okay
It’s funky
s t i l l
is this for both wrists??
The doctors don’t really have a name for it but they know it’s appearing in young women who get stressed about school and have perfectionism stuff
Uh not necessarily
Basically
My brain reads stress as danger and threat and to protect myself it causes me to be in pain
ohhh i think i've heard of that before
I had tendinitis for a while and was really stressed at school so I overworked myself too much and that’s what we think caused the bad loop
Too much archery!
ahhhh
ohhhh tendonitis is def scary
I did acupuncture, physical therapy, laser therapy, cortisone shot, dipping my arm in hot wax. It was crazy.
Yeah I had that and fluid build ups
well your brain does try to protect you but that seems hard is there a way to fix it???
i hope you're taking better care of yourself now!!! :3
The doctors didn’t know what was wrong so they put me in a brace and I lost muscle cause I wasn’t using my wrist
Yes! I try to help minimize stress and I do therapy stuff
Like rubbing fabric on my arm
https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/775661361187258438.gif?v=1
It used to feel like tons of tiny needles stabbing me over and over again
ouchhh
But now it only sometimes feels like that
hopefully it keeps getting better ahhhh
^^^^
Hyper sensitivity is annoying XD
Do not worry!
I’ve had this since middle school
It’s low key chronic pain so I forget about it sometimes
;w;
But typing too much without my funky keyboard hurts
And I have pain medicine I can use !
So it’s no worries
Do not worry !
Optimism!
pawsitivity :3
yay optimism !!
https://tenor.com/view/excited-spin-yayy-cat-peachcat-gif-22146929
y'all we should go to bed
We should
will you be bringing your funky keyboard w you thenn
oh yeah
Yes!
But I’m in bed rn
And I just wanna be with friends
okay well we should all sleep
*virtual hug*
plus zoeee we can always hang out at ucsd

y'all i just realized that ucsd has cs in the name
university of computer science dstudents
lmaooo
@everyone this Wednesday was super fun
YES
AGREED ! !!!
^^^
I liked seeing the data science people
i liked seeing everyone :3
but it was pretty fun meeting the cog sci people
i've been doing my four year planning and one thing i've been doing besides the spreadsheet ucsd has is making a google doc checklist that i'm probably going to print out so if anyone else is really struggling to track grad reqs, would suggest that + checking degree audit
"and" "ors" looking like boolean logic
lmfaoooooo
y'all is there a certain sound that reminds you of home that you're going to miss?
the doorbell
My dogs loud ass barking every time I’m in a video call
I live close to home, so probably not? Maybe my little sister.
i'm going to miss the sound of my brother's aggressive and incessant clicking noises
he got this new gaming mouse that's apparently super light so his clicking is getting louder and more aggressive
i'm just really used to that sound ahahah
kdramas on the tv downstairs is what i’ll miss
My chickens' loud ass cawing every time I'm in a video call
I missed my mom yelling at me saying the foods ready every day
ooooh what are some mobile games y'all like playing?
Brawl stars
Marvel contest of champions
Both of those games I've spent wayy too much time on
Genshin
Also brawl lmao
oh those are pretty cool!!
bloons tower defense 6 is goated
i started identity v on a whim and a reccomendation

umm should we just go to the his spis zoom then
like the one from this morning

imma just do that and see what happens lol
okayyy
@niemasd What is your zoom link? It is not listed!

how's everyone's day going?

@John._. Through the power of will and too much code I made the hq bear blurry.
Behold it's blurryness?
lmaooooo
also congrats zoe!!!!
I wrote too much code
I think there was an easier way
but I just brute forced it
It honestly isn't even that blurry
I am saddened
THE RICK ROLL HES FINALLY HERE
@Cinnamon Bun i don't think your ticket went through
Yeah I dont think so either
xD
hmmm maybe go to lab lobby & ask???
I dont wanna disturb them
tho
you could ping one of the on duty mentors??
@crossboy I don't think the tickets are working
congrats zoe
i can stop by rn srry tickets are down
should be good now!
how did everyone's enrollment go... especially those of you who were a 9 pm or smth 🥴 one of my friends got none of her classes im hoping yall had better luck
i got 3/4 of mine and hopefully i get into my waitlisted lol
o dang
GOOD LUCK which course is wl?
dsgn 1
ahh i remember seeing that full but maybe people will drop 🤞
hopefully LMAO
tbh i always wonder why they cant let a couple extra in because dont a lot of people skip discussions anyways 😳
probably
got my classes, but two of them were my second choice time slots lmao
oh thats good, yeah i had to reschedule based on DI times but not actual other courses so i just tell myself that having an extra 10 min sprint is way better than not getting the class at all
yea
gonna be waking up at 7:30 on tuesdays and thursdays 😭
🥴 ick maybe it can help your sleep schedule???
lowk same but im a early riser for some reason so it b what it b
my schedule kinda fire imo
i have to wake up early to make a phone call, i love my existence (i am being veeeeery sarcastic rn)
some ppl said evening classes might overlap with org events or other stuff so im hopin its not thattt true
math in the morning???
ooh fr fr
😭 are you trying to get into full classes
i’ve had math in the morning
all the classes i can take that don't cause conflicts with one another are waitlisted because they're all lower division since i have practically no ges left to take :3
i prefer math in the morning
im not gonna lie yall im actually a crackhead when it comes to waking up early
bc in hs i always had it zero period LOL
your mental fortitude astounds me
ah yeah i know some people who wanna get into upper div classes bc nothing else has space
math at night is walking a thin line ngl
i’ve always had math either 1st or 2nd period
but now it’s at 3pm for me aguehshsj
math at night…no❤️
LOL
fr
oh my gosh 0 period math sounds brutal
i have a math discussion at 5
math hits different in the morning tho
thats my latest class
LOL it wasss. i hated it but at least i got it over with T_T
catch me drinking green tea in math‼️
i have 3 discussions after 5
damnnn
my latest class b on monday
thursday for me
dang
bro tuesday and friday😩
soooo fine fr
I have math 7-8
my weds class ends at 6:50 :')
pm
sheeesh
o my
omg-
o
Its in Warren and my dorm is Revelle
zoe how why omo
!!!
x_X
🧍‍♀️🧍‍♀️🧍‍♀️🧍‍♀️
it was the earliest class available
otherwise it was 8-9 pm
what class
on a friday night too
wait nvm
oh my gosh
on a friday😭😭😭
holy shit
thats just crazy what math class is this??
and why are the hours like that
https://tenor.com/view/cat-sad-gif-8236582
this is why i wanted early things on friday😭
omyyyyy
its a precalc class
i still have math on friday but.. not that late omh
which I think is dumb cause I already took precalc
wtf
that sucks
wait 10 or 4
4c
ooh
I took precalc in highschool though
you couldn’t do 10
did you take the placemet?
and I've also taken a class that required calc 20b at a community college
so im just
confused
wtf-
that’s literally scam
easy a I suppose
https://tenor.com/view/forever-alone-sponge-bob-alone-sad-gif-4790128
I was mad about it but like
i guess but you’re just gonna have to pay for a course u already did
???
today for aps homework
I was dying with algebra
thats true
i didn’t even look at aps yet
APS problem 2
I had john help me
henry and i were frying our brains
oh- i looked and im kinda confused tbh
its just algebra
I can help out probably
bet
sometimes simple math is hard!!!!
John did a good job explaining it
same
i’ll probably start tomorrow
Makes sense Makes sense
cus im really not trying to math anymore tonight
I wanted it done today because I work this weekend
What code were you doing?
oh yeah its a relief to be done early tho
lab 5 random puzzle
Ohh
That's a challenge problem
Idk if I wanna attempt
lab 5 fried my brain
it looked hard
the blur, did you see my code?
was just horrid
John says I should ask for help next time
we made code for the blur but i still dont know if we did what they wanted us to
you should zoe lmaooo
I just wanted to try it on my own
Ill put it as a spoiler
omg
this was a mess
It was to make a blurry bear
girl-
and it worked
ow
how
??!?!?!?
Did you see how blurry?
i just😭
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/868552432102285373/878109972972601414/BlurBearEdited.png
versus
I did a good job
damn
damn.
waittt
that looks good
I just also did a lot more work
but the code!!!!
xD
A loop would have been better
your perseverance i could never ahahaha
but we started with like 12 lines of code for 4 pixels
lowkey isn't there technically two for loops running?
i tried to zoom in on the code but even that's blurred LOL
the blur function worked multiple ways
xD
Its cause I dont want people to cheat off me
cause you gotta learn it
I should learn how to do it without making it take like 5 minutes to run
also if they typed that much
I would be impressed
i still look at that and think i'm looking at the war and peace version of what we were supposed to do lmao
Gary would not like my code at all tbh
LOL probably true
xD
https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/775661361187258438.gif?v=1
Gary is so nice
He like emailed me back after I sent him my resume even though he didn’t talk about it in class
aw that is nice! i didnt even realize that i should have me resume done by now welp
Well I misunderstoood and had sent him the one I used to get a part time job
So it wasn’t anything like for computer or data science as it should have been for the lecture
ngl i cheated on mine and just used my school's naviance to make one back in high school, not that i ever had to use it lmao
ohh yeah the only similar thing i have is basically my condensed activities list for applications (which isnt exactly good as a resume)
i only used naviance for career quizzes or wtv but that was useless t ome
y'all turns out i have junior standing at ucsd i-
LMAOOOO
who a sophomore🥴🥴🥴
i thought i had sophomore but i just called the registrar's office and was told i had junior level soooo it all worked out and i got rid of a waitlist course and replaced it with a upper division elective ahahah
oop period
idk where it said i was a sophomore but i remember seeing it somewhere
i think it might’ve been on my easy request page
oh fr?
yee
that's niceeeeeeeeeee
it said like admittance: freshman and classification: sophomore and i was like 🥴🥴🥴🥴
i thought i was a sophomore cause i had 90 units but guess not lmfao
it is a relief though
yeah no the 90 would def put you up there
it's nice to have an enrolled course ngl
yeah fr fr
hopefully my classification will help my waitlisted class‼️
right???
like bro please
^^^^
hey y'all! i was inspired by prof politz' facets lecture a few weeks ago and ending up making a quotes website with heroku. you should add some cool quotes/ideas/fun times from earlier in the program if you have them :)
omg bet i love this
Me and the word guys gonna have to have a fight
I'm fighting demons
what?
Did anyone else get the email saying “you are authorized to enroll in CSE 8A”?
Yes newton that means u should go to webreg and click the enroll button now !
That's the priority system!
honestly i'm semi confused by the priority system (not the cse aspect but the other parts)
how important is standing?
definitey still important
you can kinda think of it like this
imagine that the course was CSE major restricted at first (or anyone else who has priority)
then after all the CSE majors get in (/other priorities), it becomes open to all
that's basically what happens, it's just it all happens behind the scenes with the waitlist
so the order you get into the waitlist still matters, because that's what decides which priorities get in first
ohhhhhh
they basically go through the waitlist and check "are they a priority? if so, send the email. if not, go to the next one". once all the majors have gotten in (or their time has passed), then just open up the class and all the people on the waitlist get let in regularly
so if i'm a freshman with junior standing does that do anything to my enrollment times or something
aside from the fact i can register for upper division courses that require a junior standing
actually
i think after this, youll have the earliest enrollment times for our class because its by units
ohhhhhh
that's nice
this quarter is going to be interesting for me ig
yeahh i dont think theyll actually put you with juniors but its an earlier times for freshmen??
ah did you finish making your sched?
i'm on waitlist for two cognitive science lower division courses
so if that doesn't work out
i'll be taking upper division elective courses that have space with my junior standing lmfao
oh wow that would be interesting for your first quarter lmao
yeah and it would mainly be the fault of my enrollment time lmfao
yeahh im glad that from now on there'll be the pass system
and hopefully not many people have as many units as you ahahah
oml that would suck
then i'd go back to having practically nothing to do/take ahahah
i really doubt it ive never heard of a junior standing freshman lmaoo
lmaooo idk most of the students i know are junior standing freshmen
but from what i remember, a lot of y'all are sophomore standing freshmen, right?
how do you hceck
the major minor area
it's open now so you can change majors and stuff
my tritonlink
90+ units is junior
i heard that for bay area sophomore standing is typical, but a lot of the ap creds dont actually count for stuff and it only helps w enrollment times
ohhhhhhh that's interestinggggggg
what does this mean
sorry only just got here
or just checked here again i mean
@jennosaur♡ / @ragdoll kitten - correct! standing contributes to your enrollment time. but it's not just unit based (i.e. highest units goes first), but rather just the standing. so all people with priority enrollment get a randomized time together, then all the seniors, then all the juniors, then all the sophmores, then all the freshmen.
@Viridion you can check on my triton link (https://act.ucsd.edu/myTritonlink20/display.htm)
ohhh interesting, ty!!
wait if i'm junior now
what's going to happen next year?
does that mean i'm a senior next year, that will be so weird
3 years of being a senior??? lmfao
i guess if you get the credits!! lol i think you dont have to worry about taking more than 4 yrs to graduate then probably
thats sos strange ahahaah
right????
its just standing haha u’d still be a first year, second year, etc
lmao i know
it would just be really funny and weird seeing senior for three years
Yea that's how it's probably gonna be lol
Shout-out to my highschool for making me take useless ap classes
Wish I would've done community college
i know the route i took isn't that popular ngl
mainly cause your social life gets really wrecked from it
ahh middle college seems to not be too well known? could you still have a "normal" social life if you wanted tho
yeah it's just really hard to do lmao
most of the time the schedules don't align plus you kinda get out of the loop w/ school activities if you don't try hard enough to keep up with them
ahh yeah and you dont always have classes at normal times right?
yeah!!!
do any of y'all play identity v? i'm going to play that if anyone else wants to join myself and some of my friends from my guild lmao
What is that?
it's a multiplayer game on mobile phones
the game is a lot like hide & seek except the seeker is dangerous
oo sounds like dead by daylight kinda lol
i think it might be???
so i googled it and yes it is like dead by daylight
@crossboy
Dead by daylight >:)
hi zoeeeeeee :3
Help did the hamstring machine at the gym and now I can't walk
you could get a wheelchair?
I see you getting those gains. *I don’t know if people actually say that. You should stretch and take care of yourself!*
yes stretches are importantttt
Yea gonna stretch from now on lmao too much pain
How many credits is considered sophomore standing?
i think 45 units completed
cause there's a minimum of 180 and divide it by four and it's 45
i have 90 and i'm at junior
so i think it's right??
hmm it says I have 48 units but says im a freshman
i have 50 and im a soph
yep, for revelle at least
but i'm also in marshall
y'all have so much ap credit
is warren different
ap and ib omg
lmao mine is college credit ahah i only took 1 ap class ever
was it worth it? maybe
i dont see why standing would be different for other colleges tho
true true
idk honestly it's lowk confusing lmao
yeah idk on my degree audit it says i have 48 credits
My college classes each were worth 6 units so they were pretty helpful
Freshman: 0 - 44.9
elective credits count in that right?
cause some of my ap credit went into elective credit
yep they do
i have 30.5 units in elective cred
you might wanna call the registrar if you're unsure
i have 42 in elect
i called them and they told me my thingy
so that makes 8 fr class creds
yeah i might just wait till we're on campus
yeah a lot of ap credit doesnt actually help with grad reqs
also vikram depends on if you want legal online textbooks lmao
lol textbooks are expensive tho :(
sometimes they make you buy homework codes too :'((
whats that
oh god those
why must we pay for more education
so rude
i think i know what those are smh
libgen is usually good?
yea but watchout with libgen just download off school wifi
also  u always have to buy hw
usually around 50-70
ohhh do they actually pay attention to if students use it
i mean most college wifi networks can see what you're browsing to start??
university wifi does track what you do, but only for legal reasons
i.e. they don't actually look through what you're doing
the only reason they look at it is if they get a report from someone saying your'e doing something illegal on their wifi
then they have to
oh that's quite interesting
i remember my high school used to force everyone to have this one browser extension so the teachers could see what tabs people had open
i know it's 11pm buuuut
Kinda tiring ngl T-T but there were fun bits
oh that's niceee
me who just spent the last hour binging pro league players for no reason
how's aps going for y'all?
are my numbers supposed to be this big
thanks for the APS help @hluu @Henry Xiao
Thanks for coming!
Glad that we can help!
thank you @crossboy and @orangehachet 
awesome! glad to hear it!!!
:profpog:
yay that's great! thanks for coming!
it's eleven so before the day ends,
went on a date :]
awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww that's cuteeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
ooooooo
oooooooooooo
yessir yessir it was fun!!
that's goood :3
thank youu!! wbu what everybody else do
after aps i had to do my game dailies, then i finished up some identity v stuff that i needed to do, and then i aggressively love bombed a bunch of people in my guild and i'm about to go back on identity v and fuel my addiction ;w;
ooh that sounds dope
💜
as alex said earlier, what about everyone else who's on ???? :3
Went to see some fish stores
I went to target
ohhh both of those sound fun!!!
The fish stores were unexpectedly crowded
Everybody wants fish
maybe lol
i turned 18 :)
WHAT
nice
Happy birthday!!
thanks!
Happy bday!
tyty :)
Is that what the status was about
ahaha yeah
congrats sam!!!!
i have a friend who i share the birthday with
so we had matching statuses for the day
awwwww that's niceeee
also happy birthdayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
What are the odds
https://tenor.com/view/happy-birthday-dog-huskies-samoyed-dance-gif-18977118
i think theres a statistic where if you have 23 people in a room there’s a 50% chance that two people share the same bday
kind of interesting
i have yet to meet someone with the same month
That is kinda interesting
much less the same birthday
What
Which month
it's been a long time since i met someone else born in january
like a few years
I know someone born in January
zoe was born in january :)
last time i met someone born in my month was like 2, almost 3 years ago
WAIT WHATTTTTTTTTt
yayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
zoeeeeeeeeeeeeee
hehe
i still remember being in school and the only person who was also celebrating their birthday in january was the kid who had the birthday in july and had to celebrate their half birthday at school instead lmao
i had a random late night thought: why do some games cause your phone to overheat?
Phone too weak
Can’t take the heat
sometimes games are chonky and use a lot of processing power for graphics or other computational things
ohhhhhhhhhhh
idv eats my battery within 3 rounds
maybe it's partially because of my giant friendlist
Omg HAPPY BDAY SAM!!
also im january too :3
OMG JENNY
YAYYYYYYYYYY
january clubbbbb
Wooo what day are you?
6th
i got pulled into an idv match but i'm getting sleepy cause i took a melatonin
what about youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
I think i know two ppl on that day lmaoo
im the 17th!
ohhh niceeeeeeeeee
hopefully your game ends quickly lol go sleepp
right?
we're still waiting for a match
i was tired 2 hrs ago i almost took a nap.... but now im not
oh how long do they usually take?
5 minutes?
idk
i'm entering one rn
we'll see how fast it takes me to die
oh gosh if it's that short, how does it dran your battery so much
okay that round was exactly 5 minutes
but i usually play back to back rounds
have you tried closing all of the background appsv
and then if i'm teamed i feel bad ditching my teammate so i end up staying way too long
i usually only run have a few?
like three
idv is apparently just a big game to be running
not as bad as genshin or a webtoon game i used to play though
genshin made my phone burn up with just loading lmfao
yike phone weak
lmaoooooooooo
i think it probably didn't help that i was playing a lot for the event as well
but it's fine cause i'm at home and i can always charge my phone :3
Boooo
well i didn't delete it over that
there was a webtoon game that made my phone heat up within a minute of me playing for whatever reason and i kept it for a few weeks before i got bored
i quit genshin cause i died 20 times over one tiny mission
oh thats so bad lol
i think i tried to download genshin
and it never worked so i never played
ahahah no i died on one of those beginner missions 20 times and just kinda went "y'know what...." and uninstalled
why are those difficult tho
whenever i start a new game i swear half the time i have to ask frinds for help on the tutorial
idv's tutorial wasn't hard, it was just painful ngl
there were 14 or 15 different parts to the whole thing, literal pain
but fr sometimes the tutorials are even more confusing than the actual game
thats so mcuh lmaooo
i wouldnt know bc i give up half the time ahahahaa
i think the 15 parts was to kind of make sure everyone can actually play properly, which is fair because idv is kinda hard without tutorial handholding
https://tenor.com/view/hello-gif-19947459
ZOEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEee
Good morning
i am semi-sleepy so if i disappear
it's melatonin
You should just sleep XD
not yet
I saw you guys chatting and thought I’d say hello
yayyyyyyyyyyyyyy
join usssssssssssssssss
i only recently learned that people can play idv on pc and i was so shook
What’s IDV
identity v, it's like the mobile phone version of dead by daylight that's free and owned by a chinese company and semi-translated
and by semi-translated i mean sometimes you see the errant chinese characters in aspects of the game
all the characters also look like they're from coraline!!!
and i currently have 90 friends despite downloading the game only around 3 days or so ago
Oh with the eyeballs gone
XD that’s so many
yeah!! most of them have button eyes
except the hunters who according to my brother, are the equivalent of dbd's killers
i never played dbd but my brother seems to think it's about the same as playing the mobile version of the game since ig the characters have a lot of crossover??
no wonder your phone is overheating
lmao
omg i'm late but happy birthday sam!!
good morning alexxxxxxxxxxx :3
good morning aerinnnn
happy belated birthday @ferreti 💖
thank youuu 💛
HAPPY BIRTHDAY ❤️
Happy birthday!! @ferreti

room/roommate assignemnts should be coming out over next couple of days
@Jun Hwang
but btw it keeps crashing now so we cant see the assignments or sign up for move in days anymore lol
probably because a bunch of people are on there trying to check rn lmfao
yeah :( i was trying to sign up and it died lmao
i swear their servers get overloaded v often
i still remember when we were applying last fall and their servers ✨ died ✨
oh that was funny i was so relieved when i saw the email because i dont even think i had half my app done by that day uhhh
or maybe my memory sucks
Feeling like @Noah Danan
Thats a nice headboard @diegom1
Thank u it's my mother's lol
Imagine not submitting it two weeks early anticipating the death of the server
https://tenor.com/view/cute-smile-anime-cunning-anime-gif-15240250
my mom literally watched me turn it in like the first or second day of november or something like that
idk it was early when i got it in
Lol
That’s good
But I remember my friends panic
lmfao i would have been part of the panic club if my mom wasn't giving me the laser eyes
Lol
I think my mom made me turn it in like a month early so I was chilling
omg our moms really saved us lmfao
i turned it in nov 30 hehe
y’all ahead of things i was like sam lmao
pffffft not by choice, really
I turned mine in at 11:59
Everything went wrong
I didn't write one of the 3 piqs I did in 1 day on Google docs
So my page got refreshed and I had to rewrite it
Then when I was done the website wasn't working on my computer
So at 11:57 I went on my phone and turned it in just in time
diego that sounds stressful
oh my gosh
but hey, you're here now! and a mentor at that so you did just fine lmaooooooooooooooooo
^^^^
Yea I made it lmao
It was but if I stressed out in the moment I wouldn't have submitted in time so I just went crazy with the thumb typing
perhaps your true hidden talent is typing really fast with your thumbs 👀
ALSO JENNY I JUST SAW YOU IN THE COGSCI SERVE CAUSE I RANDOMLY CLICKED ON IT
thumb typing o gosh
LOL i joined a while ago but i dont think ppl really use it for anything except asking questions about classes or other servers lmao
yeah fr
it's dead quiet

True!
@Steven Li
Hey y’all! I was just at Costco 🙂 right now I’m still talking with the landlord, and since there’s a chance, I don’t want to spend anyone’s precious time looking for housing. I would rly appreciate it if y’all can keep a lookout for me tho thanks! ❤️

@ragdoll kitten your data is so extensive that the bot gives off your energy
Mhm

the only one who can keep up with aerin is alex's chat bot
lmfaooooooooooooooooo
that would actually be hilarious
lowkey at the end of fall quarter we should throw gary a party or something :3
yesss also oh no i had to go somewhere so i didnt get to talk :((
garty (gary party)
Gat damn
That was one closing circle
we should have a gary day
just one full day dedicated to gary
:gary: for the culture
also i'm wondering how many reddit posts gary's leaving will spawn lmfao
national gary day
YES NATIONAL HOLIDAY
remember no leaks yet
yes :3
big spis secret!
^^
big *spis-y* secret
it was pawsitively impawsible to not do that :3
i just realized you have three text files for just me i-
got that Big Data
pffft big data
....actually i might just be big data
i have 4.2k messages in this server
ignoring thatttttttttttttttt
how have y'all been this week???
Good
pretty chill
Cooking rn
bet
oooh fun!!! what are you making?
Red beans and rice
i'm trying to drink lukewarm smoothie without dying
oh that sounds niceeee
It's from a box so
red beans make me think of mochi
Yeah
@Cinnamon Bun remember airplanes? the song? i think i just accidentally stumbled on a meme version with sonic and chuck e cheese
i'm slightly terrified
send
Cheese and rice
I do remember XD
I’m trying to think if I want to sing opera or just a normal song tonight
https://tenor.com/view/hyper-gif-18023825
I might just do jazz again cause it’s fun
ahahah i already have an idea of my "special talent" besides the obvious ones ahahah
Making everyone smile and cat facts?
are those the obvious ones?
Yes
Are they not?
well i also apparently created a lot of data for an algorithm apparently
Ohhh
which according to alex w may have gained sentience
and i think two or three weeks ago someone mentioned that i carry chat
Mhm
https://tenor.com/view/anime-zero-two-cute-smile-nod-gif-13451534
but i guess those two are pretty well known too
that and my pawisitively ridiculous obsession with dropping in cat puns :3
Puns are so good
https://tenor.com/view/puns-humanity-manatee-water-nature-gif-5414266
Ha ha
Makes me smile
yayy that's good
unfortunately the last time i jammed a cat pun into a sentence i missed one
and then i didn't realize until it was too late ;w;
are the lab times tomorrow mandatory?
i was wondering as welll
Saturday, Sunday, and Evening labs times are encouraged, useful, helpful, worthwhile, beneficial, and many other positives adjectives, but they aren't mandatory.
@John._. are you singing

y'all should drop by the zoom talent showwww
@diegom1
@diegom1
This ?
i was still stuck in my low voice mode and my dad and brother just walked by as though i was talking to them normally lmfao
we're still in the discord if ppl wanna join
i love that
they're really just desensitized to it
i wonder how surprising it would be if i randomly unmuted and just talked like that with people who have never heard my voice before
i really do
omg imagine if you used that voice with us and never talked normally
i do wonder that
i have seriously considered it
Don't it will mess your voice up
I recommend cough drops and warm water to soothe
i can go for a pretty long time lmfao
imagine that but with an asmr mic
i probably already changed my voice from it
I used to do it a lot but I stopped because its not good for singing xD
what would it sound like lmao
like that but crisp
well i've been doing it since 6th grade so i think my vocal cords are already
okay that would actually be kinda cool
it feels so weird knowing spis is ending in a week
and the week right after spis ends i'm moving on campus
but the weirdest feeling is knowing that potentially only spis bot can equal my 4k messages on the server

ahhhhhhh i was going to go to bed but then i realized lck was going on and i kinda wanna watch the first match ;w;
@John._. are you sure you typed your username in right? cause nothing came up for `@john..driscoll` lmao
theres an underscore between the two periods
yeah
that's what i thought
but that wasn't what was typed lmao
it wouldnt let me do an underscore
john.\_.driscoll
lmaoooooo
sammmmmmm i was gonna add you on linkedin when i realized you already added me who knows when
:)
remember when u were like
i have a publication
but u will never find it
anyway
yes
ahahah
and then you found it ahahah
oh yes the beautiful linkedin pfp
i-
LOL
yeah she’s stunning!!!!
that's what practically everyone who added me said that
afjdsajflafksaj
i really dont use it at all i dont know what to put
yeahhhh
that means its 10000% true
i am soooo lazy
i almost never update it until it's absolutely necessary
i dont actually use it so... i'll try to update it sometime ahahaa
just created a linkedin to add people, why does everyone have so much stuff already 😭
i don't even honestly know or remember anything i did that's on there
but y'know what? it's just there cause i put it on the list on my school's naviance and apparently did it
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
oh wow i dont think i can access my old naviance anymore and i forgot if i had stuff lol
omg naviance throwback
i think??? i downloaded my resume but mainly cause i don't remember literally anything i did in high school
its nice to have to send lil messages and add people you meet at presentations and things or recruiters
they should have major specific linkedin workshops when school starts rlly helpful
oooh that's cool
i swear some of the stuff i have only looks impressive
although i do have a classmate who published some cryptocurrency books
@alexavndra omg the heart on fire is so cuteeee
aww thank you haha
i look away for a few minutes and suddenly i'm hit with five follow requests
this is almost like what i went through back in may/juneeeeeeeeeeee

i just went on my followed hastags and i'm not disappointed by the ridiculous number of hashtags i follow
XD
I don’t know if I follow hashtags
I don’t really use Instagram
@ragdoll kitten I’m eating a snack
Whatcha up to?
How’s the coding
@ragdoll kitten your pfp on linkedin is gorgeous
i swear that's the first thing everyone comments on
nothing much, my lab partner and i aren't gonna work on the project until 3ish cause he's busy lmfao
random question but how many of y'all have a facebook
cause mine solely exists for a) linking to games and b) subtle asian traits
mine solely exists for facebook groups and events
I don’t own a linked in and I think I own Facebook but I’m not sure
i mean i joined facebook groups but i never actually get active
i only ever go on for sat
okay i just opened it and i was greeted with the image of an ikea matcha hotdog
i-
Is Facebook normally a while screen
no?
Dang then idk XD
i'm looking through and the boba-heavy content is kinda gone now
instead there's a post about some dude who gets *paid* to explain kpop
but they also have some good advice
LOL
you know what i just remembered? a lot of people like thai tea
why though? like what does it taste like?
cause it makes me think of carrot juice or something
it is a taste that ascends even carrot juice itself
there simply is no match for thai tea
all the tea flavors and juice flavors could come together at the same time and they still wouldnt stand a chance against the almighty thai tea
lmfao i guess i should try it sometime
although i'm not sure it wins against wintermelon tea or carrefour's rose tea
xD
lowkey though i wish more places had wintermelon teaaaa
diego? what?
yeh what diego?
Go for it
that reminds me
did we ever see younus's drip?
or did that never happen
i dont think so 🤨
@Younus
if anyone knows sql *ahem @ferreti * this is a really fun resource to practice: https://mystery.knightlab.com/

Peep the chain
https://github.com/veltman/clmystery They linked a command line murder mystery at the bottom @Younus
For refrigerators and microwaves, do you share them with the whole dorm or does each person have a separate one?
i think that depends on where you're staying
i'm in apartments and we apparently already have a giant fridge and a microwave?
yes maam most apartments have a microwave and fridge
lmao and yet that didn't decrease the stack of appliances that i'm supposed to take with me ;w;
you have a dining plan. what you brining?
well my parents started piling things and so far i can only recognize a fan and what looks like a water boiler lmao
or maybe it's a hot water machine
@John._. What appliances do the dorms have???
umm most dorms have a communal microwave / fridge / stove? i think its different for each college
Thank you
actually you might wanna try youtube cause i think some people did dorm tours for diff colleges
Ok thank you!
how’s today going for y’all?
It's been going well so far!
oh my gosh the last week is coming soon
😮 I feel like the month went by so fast XD
right???
but i'm also so sad that spis is ending so soon
We here now
Shout out to everyone who's gonna bring a fun wish I had one lmao
i see the j’s in the back
True
i *should* do my aps, but also i can literally feel that today is a good day where my voice is in a nice condition to be growly and i feel very very very conflicted
when are y'all moving in if you're living on campus?
sept 18!
awww that's nice!!!!
19th
19th
some of my suitemates want to move in on the 11th
but like thats a big gap of nothing to do '
omg it's like your suitemates and i shared a braincell
i'm moving in on the eleventh and now i'm packing cause it's coming so soon
so i guess my zoom orientation will happen when i'm already on campus
big pro of moving in early tho is u get to leave house
and i want to leave house
lol
i was mainly concerned about getting lost on campus and wanted an extra week to be able to at least semi-know my way around
oh thats a good idea, youll be a ucsd pro before school starts lmao
im not goin til the 21st :((
ahahah i probably won't thoughhhh
i can assure you at some points i will get sooo lost and maybe it'll end up on instagram
where i have three hours of "i actually wish i knew where i was but even google maps can't save me rn"
hahaha i guess those first few days would be nice to explore ucsd cuz not many ppl will be there
lolll im scared that maps wont be helpful because i got very confused the one time i tried to use ti
i'm hoping that within two weeks i'll be reasonably aware of what's where but also
i've been living in the bay area since i was a child and i still manage to confuse mountain view with downtown campbell
sooooooooo
ahahah i felt that though, maps are trippy sometimes
i still remember back when the car gps had my parents driving in circles
My worst nightmare is my GPS not working
I can’t find my way around anywhere unless I’m coming back home
i only know how to get home from my former high school
and i think that's the most i know
XD
all the other places i've been kinda merge in my brain
I can do work, highschool
Mom gets so mad I don’t know where the doctor is XD
I’m like: it’s somewhere straight? And she’s like
ITS TO THE LEFT
i probably know my 5 mile radius from my home and that's about it
5 miles is too generous for me
XD
i am probably not the best person to help with navigation, i've mixed my lefts and rights so many times
XD
like i hear left but my brain will say "just tell them to go right"
Aerin
Guess what I had for dinner
Lol
what??? 👀
You have to guess
It’s a guessing game
hmmmmmmmm
waffles?
It’s something fast food
And it was to appease my little sister
hmmmmmmmmmm burgers?
I learned their food is super salty/makes me a bit sick XD
Yes!
But which burger place
oh noooooooo that's bad
in n out???
Yes!
XD
Their burgers are good
that's one of my brother's favorites
But their fries are so salty
I think I may have a heart attack
...okay but my brother used to grab extra salt and put it on their fries
I haven’t gone to in and out in like 5 years
that's so longggggggggggggg
XD
I don’t really go out to fast food
fair
I’ve never been to a lot of fast food too
Like Taco Bell, Wendy’s, Carl’s junior, I don’t remember all the names
Because I don’t go XD
Is Rubios fast food?
restaurant i thought?
i never went to that one
But I feel like I see them a lot
So it’s a chain?
my brain is mainly for cataloging milk tea and other foods i like
yeah it's a chain from what i remember
XD
What’s your favorite milk tea?
i grew up drinking taro milk tea so that's my "safe tea"
Ooh
but i've been enticed to try thai tea at some point
what's your favorite milk tea?
I like Hokkaido Oolong Milk Tea
Or black teas
highkey if you're into sweet teas, wintermelon tea is great
XD
I like sweet but not too much
I need to visit Elisa at work TBH
oh you can adjust sweetness
it just depends on how much water you use
Because I am not a fan of happy lemon
And she says it’s yummy
Happy lemon, every drink I’ve had, made me feel sickly
It’s either too sweet or their boba wasn’t good
So I went three times and never went again
i don't go to happy lemon anymore cause i have bad memories (not of the menu or anything) just reminds me of a person i don't like hahah
i usually end up at tapioca express cause they have popcorn chicken :3
We should just make better memories at a happy lemon
Think of ELISA
The beautiful mentor who is allergic to lemons
ELISA makes me think of my cell bio class
XD
Why
i think there was an elisa array or something
lemme google it
Aerin why
https://tenor.com/view/yashiro-nene-hanako-no-smh-i-dont-like-gif-16549468
yeah
Goodness gracious
see i didn't exactly sleep through cell bio
I was just trying to emphasize her name
ahahahh
Aerin
How’s your project
ahahahahahah i  have no idea
https://tenor.com/view/hiding-spooked-sad-crying-cold-gif-15759512
i think we're about halfway
I’m trying to avoid APS
how's yours
omg i still have to do aps
Uh it’s due tuesday
I think
but i really just wanna talk in my growly voice instead
Rena and I are almost done?
oh yeah tuesday
We have to code lives and then we have to animate the enemies
awww that's niceeee
Then maybe make secret levels
We did a ton over the weekend
oh then it'll be like those old school arcade games
Hannah and John are so nice
that's nice!!!
They’re so helpful
It’s a god send honestly
Cause Hannah will explain stuff
And I’m like
https://tenor.com/view/bang-dream-bandori-anime-noo-scared-gif-16570497
I UNDERSTAND
WHAT MAGIC
SORCERY
I made them laugh today I think
I called things potatoes
that's good!!!
omg you said potatoes
I love potatoes
and i remember that one line from sam about potatoes from the lord of the rings
Except when they have bacon in them
i don't know why but i imagined a potato with bacon growing out of it
Nooo
That’s not a plant
i know it's not
ahahahahahah
my brain just doesn't think it isn't a plant ahahah
https://tenor.com/view/bacon-garnish-top-potato-yum-gif-12368235
https://tenor.com/view/rossweisse-dx-d-high-school-dx-d-vomit-gif-22488596
I think I just don’t like bacon on stuff much
honestly same
my brother is the literal opposite, he loves bacon to an extreme
So does my brother!
hi jaredddddd
sd post thunderstorm things
oh wow that's prettyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
even a rainbow
once i saw a rainbow that was like half formed
Bro I was terrified
Thunder is so scary
But rainbows are so pretty
there was a thunderstorm?
Yeah
Dry thunderstorm = FIRE
the mentors were talking about it too
But I don’t think any fires happened ?
the last time i got freaked out by a storm was cause some kind of summer storm was happening when i visited taiwan and i was like wth is happening cause the rain was like ahjdslhlagaslkgasfd
it's been a long time since i've seen lightning
I just don’t like it
that is honestly fair though
storms always have this scary angry noise
We were coding and I low key screamed when I heard it
awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
i guess that will be interesting, more thunderstorms
winters up here are just weird
it's like non-stop rain and aggressive wind
if it rains
and sometimes we get ice which is weird as heck
oh and once there was hail in spring
and i had to run through that cause i was in track practice and i ended up soaked
In Virginia wind could knock down playgrounds and stuff
I know cause I watched in in my friends house XD
https://tenor.com/view/anime-no-dont-no-way-gif-14108770
Places with actual weather make me^
ahahahah
I only want snow and like spring
But that’s it
Snow is annoying but I like the look of it
It’s an aesthetic I enjoy
i don't really adore snow too much cause it's cold
but i do enjoy being inside while other people are outside
which is ironic cause a good part of my life involved me being in snow
https://tenor.com/view/anime-cute-happy-winter-snow-gif-16080235
Snowman
have you ever made a snowball successfully though?
cause i have never done it
I think I have
But then I hoard it
Don’t throw perfection
Throw imperfection
ahahah
y'all my guild posted discord message activity and i'm terrified by my results
@loshy i felt that so hard, the need to update linkedin ahahahah
;     ; haven’t even looked at it in so long
terrible practice but
honestly i look at linkedin and just lose my will to update it ahahah
no yeah, it was a whole scene in my head
i really imagined someone walking into the dorm with one of those scientific tape measures
the ones that get so precise to like the .0000001
and they're like measuring people's mini fridges and suddenly they stop and tell you that your fridge is actually 5.0000001 cubic feet too large
so they tell you "sucks, but you're gonna have to take off that 0.000000001" cubic feet
use a chisel
ahahah
man i b missing things here all i see is this and linkedn links
which reminds me to update mine😭😭😭
alex hhhhhhhh
ahahah me who lost my will to update my linkedin  years ago
fr fr me too😭
especially after applying to college
Bahahah felt this
i just kinda went "no, absolutely not"
Good time to network tho sheesh
i literally made mine but there’s literally nothing😭😭😭😭
i honestly just find myself awed by my classmates who update theirs
and they do cool stuff
literally like how do u do that🥴
and i'm here like too lazy to update it
felt
Ahaaahaha dwdw! Spis can be a good addition… legit put it on my resume lmao
same ✊ 😔
And facts aerin they be on top of it
say less henry
i have more "activities" but i just don't bother adding things anymore
if they let me import my stuff from common app 👀
LMAOOOOOOO
then i would have less work in terms of activities and stuff
ahahahahh
LMAOOOO
i did so much work doing my activities on common app
it’s called being innovative
why won't linkedin save me the trouble and let me import it
;w;
work smarter not harder🦭
y e s
Write a program for it😳😳
Spis final prj

exactly
Ooh I have done both of these
wait the rice purity test opens with the whole have you dated

ahahh
ahahh

Lol I got neutral good
depends on what you check off tho
which was according to the general consensus of people i met, accurate
I can see it
what me being chaos?
Yes
...i guess you could
i knew someone who made people they were trying to get to know take a bdsm test actually
PLEASEEE LMFAO
….eh heh

wtff
Damn you Susan wojcicki
i remember having to write an sat essay about her
the only thing i remembered from that essay was her weird name
omgg yall b easy
and writing until i had no space left
is it just me who talks to discord bots sometimes?
How does that work
y'know how people chat with one another right?
sometimes i just send a message meant for the bot
one time i was kinda talking to a bot
and then someone used the speak command
and i thought it was kinda random and a bit funny, but i continued to talk to the bot-person anyway
ehhee
hi sammmmmmmmmmmmm
ohhoo
hi ethannnnnnn
Hello
how was your day?
It was alright
hi aerin and ethan!!
I slept until noon and went to Panera bread with some people that went to my school and are going to UCSD
owo
i made some posters yesterday
Panera bread is so much more exepensive than I remembered 😭
that sounds super cool !!!
Oooh of what
also inflation
https://bit.ly/girlboss_posters
that's so prettyyyyyyyyyyy
Omg
Where can I purchase these fine artworks
lowkey the funniest thing ive ever done
you may print them for free
or go to fedex and print for $15 lol
I would legitimately get 1 or 3 on quality poster paper
dorm decor o.o
You bet
I was looking at displates a week ago
You know those metal posters
oooh yeah
and I was this close to buying them
But then it dawned on me that three posters for a hundred bucks is kinda not worth it
yeah it really isn't
i honestly only really think about buying posters when i'm in taiwan ngl
it's wayyyyyyy less expensive
Everything is way less expensive in Taiwan
frrrrrrrrrr
i got a *bunch* of cute a4 folders at a decent price
and some official haikyuu stickers
it was amazing
Oooh nice
Buying anime merch is weird for me
Bc I don’t want anything that’s like overtly anime related
So it has to be like subtle enough for people who are familiar enough with it to know I’m a fan
honestly i kind of stopped minding after my dad's parents bought me a4 folders for animes i never watched
While also just being generally aesthetically pleasing enough to work as decor
they literally bought me stuff from seraph of the end and some really obscure stuff that i've never seen
but my godfather... he has taste
What are a4 folders
he got me a bunch of cute shiba folders
a4 is the paper size
Ooooh
they're a little bit bigger than the american letter size
Send pics
of what lmao
they got packed away
i'd have to send pics when i unpack at ucsd
unless you wanna see the pokemon folders they got for my brother
Sure
we have 5-6 more
i think
That’s pretty sick
yeah
my brother doesn't like pokemon anymore though lmfao
Lmaoooo
Resell it for a high price
nah
thoughts on donda?
hurricane >>>
I love christian rock 🤩
lowkey i was confused when people were talking about donda- it took me a whole minute to figure out what everyone was talking about
moon 🤩
i was scared he took cudi off
off the grid goes crazy
off the grid is nuts but it was wack to see kanye on a drill song
yeah I agree
praise god is also fire keem and travis went crazy
24/Come to Life >>>>>
A deathmatch between 100 snakes
wow that is kinda cool
it also kinda looks like tetris ahahahahah
lol thats what arnav said xD
also it's really funny how your console is printing a player died again and again and again
jun and i just learned the weirdest thing
apparently when you draw rectangles in pygame, they actually don't have a function to delete them
so people on stack overflow just suggest you draw another rectangle over the rectangle you don't want anymore
:' >
i-
THAT IS SO CUTE!!!!!
wholesome bot :cursedcry:
omg
for real!!!!!!
wait it has my first name
i am bamboozled
also hi aisha and ethannn
@AerinBot
Hi Aerin!!
wait why didn't it work
@AerinBot
it's not in this server ahahahah
Oh dang it 😭😭
nooo
idk what the bot does tbh you'd have to ask alex w or jeannie
plus to add the bot you'd need to have server edit perms
or something
yeah it's in our own testing server
for now
ahhhh this is going to be so interesting
the wholesome comes from you :'>
i-
will the bot ever leave the testing server 👀
hopefully!
we're planning on it
oh that is so fun!!!
omg that's the gif zoe likes to use!!!
in emote form o o
yes
:discodoge:
💜
💛
okay but when that bot leaves the testing server someone with the perms should add it here!!!!
lolol most def
that's amazing
i'll have a name twin ahahah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyYHWkVWQ4o
what is that i-
i'll add the aerin bot to this server if yall finish it and are okay with that!
lol younus
wait now i wanna see if the bot can keep pace with me ahahah
i have never seen that before
same
when younus said movie night i was thinking something like  ghibli film
but then he pulls up with this bean that kinda looks funky
We watched all the killer bean movies last year in spis
So it's a tradition
jk doesn't have to be killer bean
But a movie nigth would be fun
the last time i watched something with bean in the title, it was mr. bean and that was for my spanish class around 5 years ago
y e s
Ahahaha that movie is a foundational spis tradition
Need to watch it
our high school calculus teachers loved showing the mr. bean calculus episode
KILLER BEAN???
younus I’m so down
Sounds fun!
what if we had a move night marathon
where do you find your student identification number again
i think you can find it on your degree audit, it's the one that starts with an A?
hm dont see it anywhere on the degree audit
yea it should say PID and ur ID#
right below your name and major/college info
i'm doing the survey right now, but who's christine?
niema's secret name
