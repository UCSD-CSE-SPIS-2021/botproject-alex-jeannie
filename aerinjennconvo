i honestly find essays and english the easiest of all classes
i used to love timed essays


[07-Aug-21 02:57 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
i did that too on my old school account but that’s deleted now agh i should’ve changed it


[07-Aug-21 02:57 AM] king of cats#9205
and i think my teacher hated me for loving timed essays


[07-Aug-21 02:57 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
i don’t agree with you uhhh do you wanna take mmw for me LMAO


[07-Aug-21 02:57 AM] king of cats#9205
well he didn't actually hate me
i was one of his favorite students
but i would write a ton of pages of stuff
it was usually pretty thick when i was finally done


[07-Aug-21 02:58 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
ok i used to like them bc my take home essays were basically timed because i would procrastinate soo much and they’d be the same quality

[07-Aug-21 02:58 AM] king of cats#9205
yeahh
imagine how the person grading my whap test felt
they probably felt like they got slapped with a giant tidal wave of words

[07-Aug-21 02:58 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
maybe they saw the stack and just gave it a good grade :D
reminds me of how ppl would say to just ramble on act essay and you’d do well


[07-Aug-21 02:59 AM] king of cats#9205
i'm just really quick to make things up
oml that act essay is so easy
so was the sat essay
except that one time where i got a low score for arguing against the prompt
but we don't talk about that


[07-Aug-21 02:59 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
i did better on the act one for both parts lol
sad moment when i remmeber that they did nothing for my admissions
LOL


[07-Aug-21 02:59 AM] king of cats#9205
i thought the essay was the easiest part of the standardized test
i was so bad with math
i really got a 27 on math
even though i did calc ab


[07-Aug-21 03:00 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
i definitely didn’t like the essay
ripp sometimes it’s easier without the higher level knowledge tho because i think it only went to geo or alg


[07-Aug-21 03:00 AM] king of cats#9205
honestly that is so fair
ngl i did terrible in precalc/trig as in i understood almost nothing
and i still did just fine in calculus ab
i left with an a

[07-Aug-21 03:01 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
reminds me of how i tried tot tutor a 6th grader in a class i never took bc i skipped it... they were learning smth SO USELESS i didn’t know how to do it aidkskckdkcd

[07-Aug-21 03:01 AM] king of cats#9205
then a semester later i had to drop calc bc because it was like gibberish to me

[07-Aug-21 03:02 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
hmm i did rly well in precalc but bc was much more difficult but i did well bc the ap test was online and there wasn’t mcq lmao

[07-Aug-21 03:02 AM] king of cats#9205
i was lucky my professor took out the part of the final on integrals since everyone bombed that part


[07-Aug-21 03:02 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
PRE CALC

[07-Aug-21 03:02 AM] king of cats#9205
ahahah


[07-Aug-21 03:02 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
my phone hates me
i forgot how it even works


[07-Aug-21 03:02 AM] king of cats#9205
i only like derivatives
and my stats class was wayyyyyy better


[07-Aug-21 03:02 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
derivatives are easier and you don’t have to +c it


[07-Aug-21 03:03 AM] king of cats#9205
i just got to use my calculator and not show most of my work


[07-Aug-21 03:03 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
lol stats annoyed me there was too much writing

[07-Aug-21 03:03 AM] king of cats#9205
i literally took ab and bc back to back in semesters and still forgot integrals
so now i have to retake bc cause i dropped it


[07-Aug-21 03:04 AM] crossboy#7777
its okay you can take fewer courses whenever you have to take calc b (if you want to)!
you probably will have to do calc c as well but it's not as bad as calc b imo


[07-Aug-21 03:04 AM] king of cats#9205
lmao i have most of my ges done so i can't put it off much longer to begin with lmaoooo


[07-Aug-21 03:04 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
as of now i only need linear algebra but if i try to change something about my path then i might need to do 20c whatever that is and i don’t wanna have to relearn

[07-Aug-21 03:05 AM] king of cats#9205
oh that is going to be fun in the most painful way possible


[07-Aug-21 03:05 AM] crossboy#7777
doing multidimensional derivatives sounds terrible but it's not actually that bad


[07-Aug-21 03:05 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
for cogsci it isn’t required *i think*


[07-Aug-21 03:05 AM] crossboy#7777
it's literally just do the derivative twice
and that's pretty much the whole class
"do this thing you alreayd know how to do, but do it twice instead"


[07-Aug-21 03:05 AM] king of cats#9205
that is actually kinda nice


[07-Aug-21 03:06 AM] crossboy#7777
yah its definitely not as hard of a jump as b is lolol


[07-Aug-21 03:06 AM] king of cats#9205
b is not a jump
it's a shove off a cliff


[07-Aug-21 03:06 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
it doesn’t sound too bad now but idk you might just be very smart lolll
i don’t even know if calc bc also teaches a? never understood the system

[07-Aug-21 03:07 AM] king of cats#9205
it's fine though, i think my current existing college gpa can carry me even if i mess up two math classes


[07-Aug-21 03:07 AM] crossboy#7777
ya plus you might be able to take some stuff p/np as well (can't remember if math is able to be) so that's always an option


[07-Aug-21 03:07 AM] king of cats#9205
whenever i see p/np i think of that millenium problem


[07-Aug-21 03:08 AM] crossboy#7777
which problem?


[07-Aug-21 03:09 AM] king of cats#9205
it's one of those very difficult to solve math problems that has like a huge reward if you can get the correct solution


[07-Aug-21 03:09 AM] crossboy#7777
OH THAT P/NP


[07-Aug-21 03:09 AM] king of cats#9205
i want to say that one of them did get solved but i also might have remembered wrong


[07-Aug-21 03:09 AM] crossboy#7777
yeah it's a huge problem in math/cs, it might get covered in spis a bit but im not sure

[07-Aug-21 03:09 AM] king of cats#9205
i know they mentioned p/np but not the actual problem itself
i was watching gifted and the millenium problems came up
along with the trachtenberg method i think
i remember uselessly large words and then when i need to use them my brain goes b l a n k


[07-Aug-21 03:10 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
sounds like another last name


[07-Aug-21 03:10 AM] king of cats#9205
trachtenberg is a last name


[07-Aug-21 03:11 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
my brain forgets sooo many words it makes me so annoyed during timed essays because i can’t think about what that random common word is


[07-Aug-21 03:11 AM] king of cats#9205
i am usually that one student who is technically done but keeps writing anyway


[07-Aug-21 03:11 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
yeah all these equations  and methods named after people just confuse me
could never relate
i usually have half my paper written and it’s just unfinished

[07-Aug-21 03:12 AM] king of cats#9205
i know i have a large vocabulary
i just never use it
and i really like learning those random words from tumblr that are so rarely used
and then i don't use them


[07-Aug-21 03:13 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
i love that
i think i used to do that


[07-Aug-21 03:13 AM] king of cats#9205
the only time those tumblr words ever come into use is when yet another person titles a fanfic using one of those


[07-Aug-21 03:13 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
like defenestrate
i’m surprised i actually remembered one of the strange words i learned


[07-Aug-21 03:13 AM] king of cats#9205
i learned words like gracile
which i never use
and then i randomly apply chemistry terminology to real life
despite sleeping through my chemistry honors class during my second semester


[07-Aug-21 03:14 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
doesn’t even sound english tbh


[07-Aug-21 03:14 AM] king of cats#9205
i still don't know how i got an a in that class


[07-Aug-21 03:14 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
lolll i like randomly throwing in chem bc that class actually interested me


[07-Aug-21 03:14 AM] king of cats#9205
and my chem 1a was carried by huge extra credit
i overuse state function
not in the literal sense
but i just use it to mean like the process isn't important, just the destination
i think i've also equated people to the different elemental groups before


[07-Aug-21 03:15 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
oh lmaoo i was thinking boit it
wow


[07-Aug-21 03:15 AM] king of cats#9205
and people always look at me funny for it


[07-Aug-21 03:15 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
i would probably tbh LOL


[07-Aug-21 03:15 AM] king of cats#9205
not that i find it important how they feel lmfao


[07-Aug-21 03:15 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
you just seem like a metalloid today


[07-Aug-21 03:16 AM] king of cats#9205
i'll just be like "noble gas personality type" out of the blue
or i'll say someone's like a halogen


[07-Aug-21 03:16 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
oh wait groups not properties see i forogt most my chem oops
wait i could see the noble gas tho


[07-Aug-21 03:16 AM] king of cats#9205
i think the weirdest thing i've ever done was try to convert all my writing into old english runes


[07-Aug-21 03:17 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
maybe even alkaline earth it’s strange
oh i really can’t deal w old english


[07-Aug-21 03:17 AM] king of cats#9205
old english and old english runes are different
the runes looked a lot like dwarvish from lotr
and i thought they were pretty


[07-Aug-21 03:17 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
OH


[07-Aug-21 03:17 AM] king of cats#9205
yeah


[07-Aug-21 03:17 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
i just searched it ok


[07-Aug-21 03:18 AM] king of cats#9205
i mean before that i wanted to write mirror script but being left handed, i technically could have done that to start


[07-Aug-21 03:18 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
gives me hieroglyph vibes


[07-Aug-21 03:18 AM] king of cats#9205
yeah it really does
there's also elvish which is pretty
i also at one point wanted to be ambidextrous


[07-Aug-21 03:18 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
have you practiced mirror script at all?


[07-Aug-21 03:18 AM] king of cats#9205
so i can kinda write with my right hand


[07-Aug-21 03:18 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
oo elvish looks mystical


[07-Aug-21 03:18 AM] king of cats#9205
i mean i usually don't but i can do it alright


[07-Aug-21 03:19 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
ahahah i used to practice my left


[07-Aug-21 03:19 AM] king of cats#9205
i can read mirrored text just fine
i can technically draw with my right hand using a mouse


[07-Aug-21 03:19 AM] king of cats#9205
but not with a pencil


[07-Aug-21 03:19 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
there were a few stages where i literally would use my left in school but then i started to need to write fast and that didn’t work


[07-Aug-21 03:19 AM] king of cats#9205
not that well
ahahah when i write fast i end up with print-cursive


[07-Aug-21 03:20 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
i’ve never tried because i just can’t draw at all with anything LOL


[07-Aug-21 03:20 AM] king of cats#9205
the only thing i can consistently draw are cats
and sometimes bears


[07-Aug-21 03:20 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
my handwriting is pretty bad it looks scribbly because i end up connecting everythibg
i need to learn how to draw cute animals


[07-Aug-21 03:20 AM] king of cats#9205
i learned cursive and now i mix my print and cursive


[07-Aug-21 03:20 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
like just stick figure version


[07-Aug-21 03:20 AM] king of cats#9205
it looks confusing as heck though reading my notes
usually when i write words that end in ing, the i disappears
it just leaves


[07-Aug-21 03:21 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
i guess some of my writing is cursive because of how it connects but i usually don’t write things like the cursive s anymore


[07-Aug-21 03:21 AM] king of cats#9205
i also don't dot my i's anymore sooooooooo
my i's and e's look similar


[07-Aug-21 03:21 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
i haven’t written in so long i can’t remmeber how i write
many times when i write my names i don’t write 2 n’s properly


[07-Aug-21 03:22 AM] king of cats#9205
ahahahah i write things down by hand


[07-Aug-21 03:22 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
i just have some lumpy scribbled


[07-Aug-21 03:22 AM] king of cats#9205
i tend to forget otherwise


[07-Aug-21 03:22 AM] king of cats#9205
cause if i type i sometimes i forget to check where i left whatever i wrote down


[07-Aug-21 03:22 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
ah i like typing bc i’ll forget anyways LOL


[07-Aug-21 03:22 AM] king of cats#9205
honestly i just realized
i'm kinda like a function


[07-Aug-21 03:22 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
oh i guess sometimes it doesn’t motivate me to read notes as much but
hmm


[07-Aug-21 03:22 AM] king of cats#9205
i just take in input, create an output
and then i forget everything again


[07-Aug-21 03:23 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
LOL


[07-Aug-21 03:23 AM] king of cats#9205
it actually explains why i have no clue what i've turned in for the most part
especially my essays, thank goodness no one asks me to explain those


[07-Aug-21 03:23 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
Won’t comment on that bc i don’t wanna say some strange incorrect code thing in a cs server 😩


[07-Aug-21 03:23 AM] king of cats#9205
ahahah i made my brother so frustrated
he was trying to help me check my code and then he was like wth



[07-Aug-21 03:23 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
o m g do you just turn in assignments or tests and completely forget the topic or prompt


[07-Aug-21 03:24 AM] king of cats#9205
oh i don't even really remember the prompt after i write it


[07-Aug-21 03:24 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
i tried to ask my sis but i forgot she knows nothing 😭


[07-Aug-21 03:24 AM] king of cats#9205
ahahah


[07-Aug-21 03:24 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
ikr people ask what i wrote about and i’m like ... what did we even do


[07-Aug-21 03:24 AM] king of cats#9205
i literally just try to think of the easiest way to solve the problem so i can write almost zero code 
i mean i just make something up, if i get a hint of what i should say, i can usually make something up. 
guess the theatre classes i took panned out years ago


[07-Aug-21 03:25 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
i wanna write less but my brain doenst process til after i do smth rly convoluted lmao


[07-Aug-21 03:25 AM] king of cats#9205
ahhhhhh same
i usually say something and then i end up overexplaining myself


[07-Aug-21 03:26 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
oo theater fun fun those classes scare me tho


[07-Aug-21 03:26 AM] king of cats#9205
they give me so much anxiety
but i also did them ig


[07-Aug-21 03:26 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
that’s me 50% of the time if i do speak i’ll overspeak


[07-Aug-21 03:26 AM] king of cats#9205
technically i guess i can act, i'm good with expressions


[07-Aug-21 03:26 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
but a lot of times i just don’t speak at all lol


[07-Aug-21 03:26 AM] king of cats#9205
ahahah when we had to do closing circle i really wrote out what i was going to say i still panicked anyway ahahah


[07-Aug-21 03:27 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
oo i just know i did one acting thing as a child and i laugh sm when i watch now and wonder what the heck happened to me


[07-Aug-21 03:27 AM] king of cats#9205
i used to do musicals so theoretically i should be okay with like idk stages?
but i'm not


[07-Aug-21 03:27 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
oh i didn’t get to go today :( how was it? forogt to ask someone about it


[07-Aug-21 03:27 AM] king of cats#9205
it took a long time and everyone just kinda thanked other people


[07-Aug-21 03:28 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
i used to have the worst stage fright (probably still do)


[07-Aug-21 03:28 AM] king of cats#9205
and i just read whatever i wrote while panicking oh i have stage fright too


[07-Aug-21 03:28 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
aw that’s nice i would probably not wanna speak up tho lmao


[07-Aug-21 03:28 AM] king of cats#9205
the deer in the headlights oh it was mandatory for everyone


[07-Aug-21 03:28 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
oh well
guess i’ll experience it next week=
ajejdkskckdkck


[07-Aug-21 03:29 AM] king of cats#9205
i swear things were easier when we were kids like being on stage and stuff i don't know how i did it then


[07-Aug-21 03:29 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
everything was easier then


[07-Aug-21 03:29 AM] king of cats#9205
it really wassss


[07-Aug-21 03:29 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
i really wanna channel my younger energy but i cannot comprehend


[07-Aug-21 03:29 AM] king of cats#9205
honestly i was thinking back to the musicals i did and i just realized how weirdly sexist my fair lady was like there's this whole song when the english professor rants about women


[07-Aug-21 03:30 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
i don’t rly know musicals well but i guess many were made back in the day where it was normal to be misogynistic


[07-Aug-21 03:30 AM] king of cats#9205
trueeeee honestly i got into musicals because of my parents


[07-Aug-21 03:31 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
i think a few years ago i wanted to try to do a musical but obviously my stage fright completely killed that


[07-Aug-21 03:31 AM] king of cats#9205
awwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
i think the first musical i saw was les mis or phantom i didn't understand the lovely ladies thing until like years later


[07-Aug-21 03:31 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
oo do your parents watch a lot


[07-Aug-21 03:31 AM] king of cats#9205
no not really


[07-Aug-21 03:31 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
my first (and only i think) was phantom


[07-Aug-21 03:32 AM] king of cats#9205
my dad just had them and i was introduced to them early although i watched ghibli films long before that


[07-Aug-21 03:32 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
ah makes sense oh those are all cute throwbacks now


[07-Aug-21 03:32 AM] king of cats#9205
i think the last muscial i saw was carrie


[07-Aug-21 03:33 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
oh wait i saw hamilton last year but it was from home so idk if that counts lol


[07-Aug-21 03:33 AM] king of cats#9205
ohhh hamilton is fun 
i don't remember if i did but i was looking forward to the in the heights film


[07-Aug-21 03:33 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
i just know it was free on disney + for a bit and my sister had my friends account lmao


[07-Aug-21 03:34 AM] king of cats#9205
did you ever have a gymnastics phase?

[07-Aug-21 03:34 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
omg i did gymnastics in prek i think lmao

[07-Aug-21 03:34 AM] king of cats#9205
ahahah sameeeeeeeeeee
and then i stopped
but i really wanted to do a handstand, so i taught myself


[07-Aug-21 03:35 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
started dance around that time tho and that was what i stuck with but i did have a few phases throughout where i wanted to do gymnastics things


[07-Aug-21 03:35 AM] king of cats#9205
i swear everyone did back in those days
ahahah


[07-Aug-21 03:35 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
oh sound of music has nice songs at least the ones i know lol


[07-Aug-21 03:35 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
i still can’t handstand


[07-Aug-21 03:35 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
i’m WEAK


[07-Aug-21 03:35 AM] king of cats#9205
i did ballet i think idk


[07-Aug-21 03:35 AM] king of cats#9205
i don''t remember


[07-Aug-21 03:35 AM] king of cats#9205
i can still do it, but it's best when you're in a pool


[07-Aug-21 03:35 AM] king of cats#9205
soo much easier


[07-Aug-21 03:36 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
i did ballet til 7th i think then technically did it in hs but not rly


[07-Aug-21 03:36 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
oh i’ve never tried in a pool


[07-Aug-21 03:36 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
i don’t like water tbh i can’t even breathe easily when i’m standing in a pool lolll


[07-Aug-21 03:36 AM] king of cats#9205
ohhh


[07-Aug-21 03:37 AM] king of cats#9205
that actually makes sense


[07-Aug-21 03:37 AM] king of cats#9205
you could also do it against a wall


[07-Aug-21 03:37 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
i can see how handstand would be easier but like id prob choke on water LOL


[07-Aug-21 03:37 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
oh yes i used to do that but my arms would give out too soon hehe


[07-Aug-21 03:37 AM] king of cats#9205
i honestly went through trial and error to do it


[07-Aug-21 03:38 AM] king of cats#9205
but i also did basketball as a sport


[07-Aug-21 03:38 AM] king of cats#9205
soooooooooo


[07-Aug-21 03:38 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
i guess i didn’t care much about handstands bc i wanted to be flexible and do tricks more lmao


[07-Aug-21 03:38 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
oh sports not my thing but tbh basketball was an ok unit in pe loll


[07-Aug-21 03:38 AM] king of cats#9205
i can't say if sports were really my thing


[07-Aug-21 03:38 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
tho i’ve barely scored any baskets in my life


[07-Aug-21 03:38 AM] king of cats#9205
i just did them


[07-Aug-21 03:38 AM] king of cats#9205
same


[07-Aug-21 03:39 AM] king of cats#9205
i was only good at guarding


[07-Aug-21 03:39 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
dance was my only athletic thing ever til that one year of track ew


[07-Aug-21 03:39 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
yeah i can’t do that either but ehhh whatwver LOL


[07-Aug-21 03:39 AM] king of cats#9205
i just didn't like doing offensive stuff


[07-Aug-21 03:39 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
not gonna play bball in the future or anything


[07-Aug-21 03:40 AM] king of cats#9205
honestly if i actually focused on cross country, my stamina would probably be better smh


[07-Aug-21 03:40 AM] king of cats#9205
i think by the end of the season was when my stamina was just beginning to get good


[07-Aug-21 03:40 AM] king of cats#9205
and then the season ended ahahahah


[07-Aug-21 03:40 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
but that’s the hard part :’) idk how people have the motivation i wish i could


[07-Aug-21 03:40 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
ahhhh yeah


[07-Aug-21 03:40 AM] king of cats#9205
i don't even know how i convinced myself to run 2 miles


[07-Aug-21 03:40 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
once an xc friend tricked me into running 3 MILES i thought i was gonna die


[07-Aug-21 03:41 AM] king of cats#9205
and the worst part was i had a friend who was shouting at me to run faster ahahah


[07-Aug-21 03:41 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
1 is my max bc it’s required in pe smh


[07-Aug-21 03:41 AM] king of cats#9205
honestly 1 mile is so nice


[07-Aug-21 03:41 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
oh no that pressure when you’re alrd dying trying to pace yourself


[07-Aug-21 03:41 AM] king of cats#9205
pfft i would actually slow down


[07-Aug-21 03:41 AM] king of cats#9205
just to spite him ahahah


[07-Aug-21 03:41 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
i disagree 1 lap is more than enough LOL i did sprints in t&f bc i wanted to hurdle


[07-Aug-21 03:41 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
good solution 😌


[07-Aug-21 03:42 AM] king of cats#9205
oml the 400 m as a track event is so hardddddddddd


[07-Aug-21 03:42 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
AGREED


[07-Aug-21 03:42 AM] king of cats#9205
i still remember doing training


[07-Aug-21 03:42 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
i literally never did it before but my first meet, they signed everyone up for the 400


[07-Aug-21 03:42 AM] king of cats#9205
i'd have to do those weird things where you sprint 50 m and walk 50 m or something and go up by increments of 50 or something


[07-Aug-21 03:42 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
i basically died


[07-Aug-21 03:42 AM] king of cats#9205
i ran a 3200 once


[07-Aug-21 03:42 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
ohh yeah i think we did that


[07-Aug-21 03:42 AM] king of cats#9205
it was horrid


[07-Aug-21 03:42 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
ewww


[07-Aug-21 03:42 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
disgusting n


[07-Aug-21 03:42 AM] king of cats#9205
i did pretty good in 400


[07-Aug-21 03:43 AM] king of cats#9205
and then i quit


[07-Aug-21 03:43 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
after the first meet i never did the 409 again even tho i was supposed to lmao


[07-Aug-21 03:43 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
i did horrendous in literally everything but jumps and hurdles


[07-Aug-21 03:43 AM] king of cats#9205
honestly lining up gives me anxiety


[07-Aug-21 03:43 AM] king of cats#9205
i just get all freaked out being in line and stuff


[07-Aug-21 03:43 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
WHCIH WERE THE REASON I WANTD TO JOIN but didn’t think i’d need to just run for 95% of practice


[07-Aug-21 03:43 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
YES


[07-Aug-21 03:43 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
and the gun scared me lol i have slow reflexes too


[07-Aug-21 03:44 AM] king of cats#9205
oh yeah, track definitely is like RUN RUN RUN


[07-Aug-21 03:44 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
i joined with friends who also just wanted to do jumping events but they quit i forgot why


[07-Aug-21 03:44 AM] king of cats#9205
i used to just watch people get smoked


[07-Aug-21 03:44 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
and i was left there not realizing jumping is for sprinters who only run during practice and have to stay extra to do other stuff lmao


[07-Aug-21 03:44 AM] king of cats#9205
like one of the soccer players was in track and he would outsprint practically everyone in the 100m


[07-Aug-21 03:45 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
ok but it’s sometimes interesting to wat h fast ppl


[07-Aug-21 03:45 AM] king of cats#9205
i find it hilarious


[07-Aug-21 03:45 AM] king of cats#9205
also perhaps we should sleep


[07-Aug-21 03:45 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
like i could never dream of moving at that speed it looks so strange


[07-Aug-21 03:45 AM] king of cats#9205

[07-Aug-21 03:45 AM] jennosaur♡#5678

[07-Aug-21 03:46 AM] king of cats#9205

[07-Aug-21 03:46 AM] king of cats#9205

i literally read it that way before seeing your message too 😭


[07-Aug-21 12:55 PM] king of cats#9205
that’s hilarious


[07-Aug-21 12:55 PM] king of cats#9205
you know what i find really weird about spotify, and yes it’s really random


[07-Aug-21 12:56 PM] king of cats#9205
i set my language as english but it will still give me ads in spanish sometimes even though i don’t really understand spanish at all


[07-Aug-21 12:56 PM] king of cats#9205
sure i took three years of spanish, but i also didn’t really understand it lmao


[07-Aug-21 12:56 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
have you googled spanish stuff lmaoo


[07-Aug-21 12:56 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
cant relate i have premium 😌


[07-Aug-21 12:57 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
though i do wonder what type of ads i would get


[07-Aug-21 12:57 PM] king of cats#9205
i don’t do anything in spanish at all lmao


[07-Aug-21 12:57 PM] king of cats#9205
the last time i googled spanish was for google translate


[07-Aug-21 12:58 PM] king of cats#9205
my spanish 3 teacher really thought i knew how to write essays but none of us learned how to in spanish 2


[07-Aug-21 12:58 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
maybe they think you wanna learn spanish that way but like i don’t even know how ad algorithm works


[07-Aug-21 12:58 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
ah sounds like chinese the first time we had to write essays too


[07-Aug-21 12:58 PM] king of cats#9205
lmaooo idk how the ad algorithms work either


[07-Aug-21 12:59 PM] king of cats#9205
youtube likes to give me men’s deodorant ads lmfao


[07-Aug-21 12:59 PM] king of cats#9205
i swear every foreign language teacher assumes you can write essays at a certain point


[07-Aug-21 01:00 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
i used to either get the strangest or the most accurate ads it was kinda strange but now i use adblock lol


[07-Aug-21 01:01 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
YEAH i think they just think that since you know how to write in english, you can just put that to your other lang skills


[07-Aug-21 01:01 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
also i’m on the car and getting kinda carsick so ttyl lmao


[07-Aug-21 01:02 PM] king of cats#9205

[07-Aug-21 06:12 PM] king of cats#9205
aaaaaaaaa that sounds p long for a walk


[07-Aug-21 06:13 PM] king of cats#9205
especially if you haven’t been walking much


[07-Aug-21 06:13 PM] king of cats#9205
ngl i don’t go outside most days of the week myself ahaha


[07-Aug-21 06:13 PM] jennosaur♡#5678

[07-Aug-21 06:14 PM] king of cats#9205

[07-Aug-21 06:14 PM] king of cats#9205
otherwise i’m like, i’ll just stay indoors


[07-Aug-21 06:14 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
definitely lol my parents usually can’t even get me to open the door to get some light


[07-Aug-21 06:15 PM] king of cats#9205
lmaooo


[07-Aug-21 06:15 PM] king of cats#9205
i feel like it’s such a hassle going outside


[07-Aug-21 06:16 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
it really is... i know it’s good for me and all that but


[07-Aug-21 06:16 PM] king of cats#9205
my parents are like wear a mask, wipe your hands every time you get back to the car, wash them when you get home, wipe everything you buy


[07-Aug-21 06:16 PM] king of cats#9205
i felt that sooooo hard


[07-Aug-21 06:16 PM] king of cats#9205
i swear my doctor is secretly thinking that this is exactly why i have a vitamin d deficiency


[07-Aug-21 06:17 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
ohhh yeah i think for the first year my mom religiously wiped everything but i think now we’re just like whatever it should be alright


[07-Aug-21 06:17 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
oh 😭 i started taking d3 pills ever since i went to the doc a few weeks ago LOL


[07-Aug-21 06:18 PM] king of cats#9205
i was supposed to start taking them way back in 6th grade after i went to my doctor about wrist pain


[07-Aug-21 06:18 PM] king of cats#9205
i had to get examined pretty thoroughly cause she was convinced i either had arthritis or carpal tunnel


[07-Aug-21 06:18 PM] king of cats#9205
but then they did bloodwork ig and i had a vitamin d deficiency


[07-Aug-21 06:19 PM] king of cats#9205
ofc i constantly forget to take the pills lmfao


[07-Aug-21 06:19 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
oh my it was that bad :// lol i keep forgetting as well


[07-Aug-21 06:19 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
tbh i should take all the vitamins uhh i think i’m deficient in everything healthy


[07-Aug-21 06:19 PM] king of cats#9205
well she prescribed painkillers that didn’t work soooooo i guess that was why she thought that?


[07-Aug-21 06:20 PM] king of cats#9205
m e


[07-Aug-21 06:20 PM] king of cats#9205
i have like two i have to take daily


[07-Aug-21 06:20 PM] king of cats#9205
and one of them is like an inch long


[07-Aug-21 06:20 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
why did the painkillers already not work oh no i thought those were supposed to gradually stop working


[07-Aug-21 06:20 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
sounds so funnn i’ve never been prescribed anything long term before


[07-Aug-21 06:21 PM] king of cats#9205
i have no idea honestly


[07-Aug-21 06:21 PM] king of cats#9205
i guess it was cause it wasn’t something painkillers could help with??? idk but it got better because of the vitamin d supplements lmao


[07-Aug-21 06:22 PM] king of cats#9205
i’m gonna have to take two giant bottles of supplements with me and my melatonin ahaha


[07-Aug-21 06:22 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
oh i kinda forgot what d even helps with... was it bone strength? i guess thatd make sense


[07-Aug-21 06:22 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
ah melatonin


[07-Aug-21 06:23 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
i keep stopping myself from taking it even though multiple people have told me to lol


[07-Aug-21 06:23 PM] king of cats#9205
my parents bought it for me after a psychiatrist said to i think, or something


[07-Aug-21 06:23 PM] king of cats#9205
it’s nice when i messed up my sleep schedule and need to brute force fix it


[07-Aug-21 06:24 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
oh yeah that’s true it can stop your sleep from getting worse and worse and worse


[07-Aug-21 06:24 PM] king of cats#9205
which is exactly what i need to do today


[07-Aug-21 06:24 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
i guess i’m saving it for when i really need it so that it’ll actually work on me lolll


[07-Aug-21 06:24 PM] king of cats#9205
i went out, came home and napped soooo i just woke up a few minutes agoo


[07-Aug-21 06:25 PM] king of cats#9205
yeah don’t overtake


[07-Aug-21 06:25 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
oh love that i took a short nap in the car earlier


[07-Aug-21 06:25 PM] king of cats#9205
i knew someone who took a bunch of high dosage melatonin and at some point it just stopped working


[07-Aug-21 06:26 PM] king of cats#9205
so def be careful about taking too much cause the stronger sleep meds are illegal here i think or at the very least, extremely difficult to obtain


[07-Aug-21 06:26 PM] king of cats#9205
at least from what i’ve heard


[07-Aug-21 06:26 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
oh i wouldn’t be surprised yeah


[07-Aug-21 06:27 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
i also don’t wanna be reliant on it so i assume it’ll be a once in a while thing (but idk i have no idea how it’s like so i don’t wanna get addicted LOL)


[07-Aug-21 06:27 PM] king of cats#9205
oh it’s weird as heck when it kicks in


[07-Aug-21 06:28 PM] king of cats#9205
it kinda feels like when you’re sick and you took medicine and you’re slowly getting increasingly tired


[07-Aug-21 06:28 PM] king of cats#9205
and then you’re guaranteed around 5 hours i think


[07-Aug-21 06:28 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
oh wow


[07-Aug-21 06:28 PM] king of cats#9205
but it’s not like it instantly kicks in


[07-Aug-21 06:29 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
all i remember is that once i was sick and i took nyquil to help slepe and instead i woke up like 1-2 hrs later and got even more sick smh


[07-Aug-21 06:29 PM] king of cats#9205
ahhhhh being sick sucksssss


[07-Aug-21 06:29 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
ah it’s like a delayed thing


[07-Aug-21 06:29 PM] king of cats#9205
another reason why i don’t go outside


[07-Aug-21 06:29 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
yeah i literally woke up and RAN to the bathroom it was not fun


[07-Aug-21 06:30 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
yeah omg i also kinda skipped allergy season because i didn’t go outside

[07-Aug-21 06:30 PM] king of cats#9205

[07-Aug-21 06:31 PM] jennosaur♡#5678

lol i literally just picked up my phone


[07-Aug-21 07:23 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
oh gosh i gotta do that when i get back


[07-Aug-21 07:24 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
i started but i procrastinated


[07-Aug-21 07:25 PM] king of cats#9205
i'm telling myself i have to get it done


[07-Aug-21 07:25 PM] king of cats#9205
i spent all of high school procrastinating


[07-Aug-21 07:25 PM] king of cats#9205
and i have some pretty interesting stories from that


[07-Aug-21 07:25 PM] king of cats#9205
so needless to say, i'm trying to get it together and not do that through all of college ahahah


[07-Aug-21 07:27 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
see i tell myself i’m gonna improve in college but who knows what’ll actually happen


[07-Aug-21 07:28 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
i don’t even count doing a small-ish assignment the day before procrastinating tho LOL especially since i’ve kinda looked at it and thought about it


[07-Aug-21 07:29 PM] king of cats#9205
i procrastinated on a whap shower curtain and ended up ruining a decent jacket over it


[07-Aug-21 07:29 PM] king of cats#9205
so i'm trying not to have a repeat of that in college


[07-Aug-21 07:29 PM] king of cats#9205
i just realized i also semi-slept through the star wars unit of my whap class and some of my english classes before


[07-Aug-21 07:33 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
shower curtain???


[07-Aug-21 07:34 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
and star wars? that seems so strange in whap lmaoo i didn’t take that class but my friends only had boring old history stuff


[07-Aug-21 07:44 PM] king of cats#9205
did no one else take whap and have to do a giant shower curtain?


[07-Aug-21 07:44 PM] king of cats#9205
as for star wars, my teacher had us watch it to learn how to write the long essays questions and the saqs


[07-Aug-21 07:45 PM] king of cats#9205
apparently it had all the proper components for a response that would get you a good score


[07-Aug-21 07:46 PM] king of cats#9205
but i really just kinda slept through part of the star wars thing


[07-Aug-21 07:46 PM] king of cats#9205
although my teacher was a *huge* star wars fan, as in he had boba fett tattooed on his arm


[07-Aug-21 07:47 PM] king of cats#9205
so maybe he just chose star wars cause he liked it a bunch ahahah

{Reactions}
😆 

[07-Aug-21 07:50 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
oh that’s interesting i guess it’s a good way to get some ppl engaged lol


[07-Aug-21 07:50 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
uh maybe but i’ve never heard a word about it and it sounds so out of place 😩


[07-Aug-21 07:50 PM] king of cats#9205
honestly though i can understand star wars being unique


[07-Aug-21 07:50 PM] king of cats#9205
but i swear it wasn't just me who had to do the giant shower curtain thing


[07-Aug-21 07:51 PM] king of cats#9205
i had to go out and buy a giant shower curtain in like april or may to use it for the project


[07-Aug-21 07:51 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
i don’t rly like star wars oops i fell asleep when i tried to watch once


[07-Aug-21 07:51 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
lmaoo maybe it’s a more common thing but it just sounds so strange


[07-Aug-21 07:52 PM] king of cats#9205
and then i kinda procrastinated until like 11 pm and stayed up until 5 am doing the project and at some point i absentmindedly messed up and one of my sleeves turned pitch black and my arm got stained too


[07-Aug-21 07:52 PM] king of cats#9205
all because i rested my arm on an uncapped black sharpie


[07-Aug-21 07:52 PM] king of cats#9205
ofc i finished the giant shower curtain and managed to turn it in just fine and got a decent grade on it


[07-Aug-21 07:52 PM] king of cats#9205
but i ruined a decent jacket over it


[07-Aug-21 07:52 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
oh no omg sharpies are impossible


[07-Aug-21 07:53 PM] king of cats#9205
yeah and the jacket was my basketball one :p


[07-Aug-21 07:53 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
ah yes the skill of finishing things before the deadline no matter what


[07-Aug-21 07:53 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
aww


[07-Aug-21 07:53 PM] king of cats#9205
thank goodness my season was over or i'd have to explain the giant black stain of sharpie that wouldn't come out


[07-Aug-21 07:53 PM] king of cats#9205
y e s


[07-Aug-21 07:54 PM] king of cats#9205
i used to hear my english teachers in high school tell people not to procrastinate on the essays


[07-Aug-21 07:54 PM] king of cats#9205
and then there was me who also put it off and took like 4-5 hours to write one essay and turn it in


[07-Aug-21 07:54 PM] king of cats#9205
i don't know if they actually knew i was doing the essay last minute or not though


[07-Aug-21 08:05 PM] king of cats#9205
jennyyyyyyyyyy, how's the event?


[07-Aug-21 08:20 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
LOL that would be so awkward


[07-Aug-21 08:20 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
ok every teacher ever tho


[07-Aug-21 08:20 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
they all remind us not to but we still do hehe


[07-Aug-21 08:20 PM] king of cats#9205
riiiiiight?


[07-Aug-21 08:20 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
i feel like some teachers know not even bc of the quality but by how you act or if you talk to ppl about it


[07-Aug-21 08:20 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
also i convinced my mom to let me leave :)))) she had no objection tho she didnt wanna be there either


[07-Aug-21 08:21 PM] king of cats#9205
that's niceeeee :3


[07-Aug-21 08:21 PM] king of cats#9205
also lowkey, i think my teachers know cause i turn things in at such odd hours


[07-Aug-21 08:21 PM] king of cats#9205
it'll be four am and my essay will just be submitted


[07-Aug-21 08:21 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
oh true my chem teacher never let me off after i think i emailed him a question at 2-3 am


[07-Aug-21 08:21 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
oopsies


[07-Aug-21 08:21 PM] king of cats#9205
i have a trick for that


[07-Aug-21 08:21 PM] king of cats#9205
i just preset my send


[07-Aug-21 08:22 PM] king of cats#9205
i'll have emails sending at 8 am when i'm fast asleep ahahah


[07-Aug-21 08:22 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
oh YES i would start doing that now but i think it wasnt a thing back then or i didnt rly care


[07-Aug-21 08:22 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
i used to submit a lot of stuff at 6-7 so they might just think i woke up early 😌


[07-Aug-21 08:22 PM] king of cats#9205
ahahahah


[07-Aug-21 08:23 PM] king of cats#9205
i usually have things in at weird times since i actually feel motivated for whatever reason at weird hours


[07-Aug-21 08:23 PM] king of cats#9205
i think that by the end of high school, my teachers just kinda stopped asking questions about why in the world i was up at like 2 am


[07-Aug-21 08:23 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
oh for sure i dont work efficiently until i have time pressure


[07-Aug-21 08:24 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
sometimes i try to start early but i know it takes me a lot longer if i dont have the deadline in front of my face lmao


[07-Aug-21 08:24 PM] king of cats#9205
that's why i liked timed essays so muchhhhhhhhhh


[07-Aug-21 08:24 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
yeah i think they all got used to it


[07-Aug-21 08:24 PM] king of cats#9205
i seriously can't think of anything to write when i'm trying to write an essay early usually


[07-Aug-21 08:24 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
i would say same but i also just hate essays LOL i'd much rather have timed tho so they have lower expectations


[07-Aug-21 08:24 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
IKR


[07-Aug-21 08:24 PM] king of cats#9205
i have an unimaginable amount of run on sentences


[07-Aug-21 08:24 PM] king of cats#9205
it's not even a joke
i try really hard not to, but it happens so muchhhhh


[07-Aug-21 08:25 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
but tbh sometimes idk what to write during a timed one either... like once in lang i think i sat there for 15 min with a blank paper then decided to bs it
well it happens more when im rambling
like my long blocks of msgs that have 0 punctuation


[07-Aug-21 08:25 PM] king of cats#9205
oml i try not to let my sentences get too long


[07-Aug-21 08:25 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
i think in essays i at least use ,cc or make it somehow grammatically correct but just long and wordy
*try is the key word for me but i usually fail lolll


[07-Aug-21 08:26 PM] king of cats#9205
but i got into a bad habit of writing exceedingly long sentences with no real idea of when i should stop the sentence


[07-Aug-21 08:26 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
yeah! and its also strange to separate into short sentences sometimes


[07-Aug-21 08:26 PM] king of cats#9205
i used to get in so much trouble for having like 10 different run ons


[07-Aug-21 08:26 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
it just sounds so robotic to me idk how to explain it
i definitely had comments about that lol


[07-Aug-21 08:27 PM] king of cats#9205
i don't get how anyone writes essays without run ons


[07-Aug-21 08:27 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
yeah sometimes the ideas come while youre writing and it all relates so i wanna keep it in one sentence! but some ppl just know what theyre saying beforehand so it sounds good lol


[07-Aug-21 08:27 PM] king of cats#9205
that is so true
but also when i usually write, it's not for schoolwork so i created a bunch of really really really bad habits


[07-Aug-21 08:28 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
oo do you do creative writing


[07-Aug-21 08:28 PM] king of cats#9205
yessssssss
what about youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu


[07-Aug-21 08:28 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
woooo im definitely not creative enough to write so nopee


[07-Aug-21 08:29 PM] king of cats#9205
lmao do you have any other hobbies? :3


[07-Aug-21 08:29 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
but one of my freidns does and she wrote a lord of the flies fanfic with our freidns in it and i think its about 200 google doc pages AHAFHJSFHSJDB
im kinda boring i dont do anything anymore


[07-Aug-21 08:29 PM] king of cats#9205
oml i could neverrrrrrrrrrr


[07-Aug-21 08:29 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
i used to dance and sing hehe but since quarantine i havent rly done either


[07-Aug-21 08:29 PM] king of cats#9205
ohhhhhhh that's so cool
there's this stage apparently near 6th that does karaoke?


[07-Aug-21 08:30 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
i would sit around bored thinking of things to do but not actually doing it... then 2021 started and i finally started watching shows to pass time but thats not rly productive


[07-Aug-21 08:30 PM] king of cats#9205
or maybe i just don't remember which college correctly ahahah


[07-Aug-21 08:30 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
:o
but i also am too scared of people to sing in front of others LOL


[07-Aug-21 08:30 PM] king of cats#9205
i think i've only ever written 150 ish pages


[07-Aug-21 08:30 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
thats still crazy


[07-Aug-21 08:30 PM] king of cats#9205
but i have hit 200 pages compiling recipes i found interesting
i think cookbooks are one of the faster ways to have an insane amount of pages


[07-Aug-21 08:31 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
oh wow i keep on wanting to learn to cook but i dont really know what the heck we have at home so i also just give up oops
ingredient lists can take up a lot of space lmao


[07-Aug-21 08:31 PM] king of cats#9205
honestly, i don't know how to cook, i just follow the instructions
it works out just fine


[07-Aug-21 08:32 PM] king of cats#9205
wait jennyyyyyyyyyyy
what shows have you been watchinggg


[07-Aug-21 08:32 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
tbh i havent ever tried by myself bc ii dont actually wanna eat whatver i want to make lolll
hmmm i started with kdramas then moved to cdramas
no american shows unforunatley
or anime


[07-Aug-21 08:32 PM] king of cats#9205
ahahah cdramas
i admire your patience


[07-Aug-21 08:33 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
LOL
not me watching in 2x speed for everything ever tho


[07-Aug-21 08:33 PM] king of cats#9205
my parents used to have me watch those taiwanese tv shows and ahklajdfks


[07-Aug-21 08:33 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
:o i never watched but theyd run in the background lmao


[07-Aug-21 08:33 PM] king of cats#9205
i would just be like "HURRY UP AND GET TOGETHER, IT'S SO OBVIOUS YOU TWO WILL DATE"


[07-Aug-21 08:33 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
AHAHAHA most romcoms are all the same and cliche now


[07-Aug-21 08:34 PM] king of cats#9205
fr fr


[07-Aug-21 08:34 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
i havent rly been watching much these past 2 months tho
which is good ig because i cant binge during school lol
or can i


[07-Aug-21 08:34 PM] king of cats#9205
n o


[07-Aug-21 08:35 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
eh i should probably be more socially involved instead of watching something i dont even feel like watching sometimes 😩 litearlly some shows were for the sake of wasting a day away


[07-Aug-21 08:35 PM] king of cats#9205
i felt that
honestly i'm kinda surprised no one has joined us yetttttttttt


[07-Aug-21 08:36 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
i guess no one checks this server randomly lolll
oh yeah do you think youre gonna join any clubs?


[07-Aug-21 08:36 PM] king of cats#9205
honestly i have no idea


[07-Aug-21 08:36 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
felt that so hard


[07-Aug-21 08:36 PM] king of cats#9205
i mean there are so manyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy


[07-Aug-21 08:37 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
ikr ! seems overwhelming tbh


[07-Aug-21 08:37 PM] king of cats#9205
it's like high school clubs x 100 i swear


[07-Aug-21 08:37 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
but my sister was like "youd BETTER go to the club tables and go to events and stuff etc etc"
ikr i tried to go to some but i went once and dipped oops-


[07-Aug-21 08:37 PM] king of cats#9205
let's be real, i didn't join any clubs in high school
i didn't join any clubs at the community college i was at either
i don't think clubs were as important as people thought they were


[07-Aug-21 08:38 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
i "joined" a few but i cant actually name a single one that i went to and knew what was happening in
mhm unless you were an owner or had a position AND it was actually somewhat influential


[07-Aug-21 08:38 PM] king of cats#9205
my honors bio teacher had an anime club that i occasionally crashed
i remember she liked one piece
oh i have a horror story about a club leader
it's not like horror horror
but man it sucked


[07-Aug-21 08:39 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
:oo oh no what happeend


[07-Aug-21 08:40 PM] king of cats#9205
so this kid was a freshman in my chem honors class cause he apparently took a bio class at harker summer before school started and he made a science club which he claimed would be amazing
ofc i ended up joining cause i was interested and he said he wanted to be a cardiothoracic surgeon and i thought perhaps there would be dissections and fun things
instead, i found out we were studying
yes, *studying*
and it wasn't like the normal stuff we learn in high school, we were studying for the national science bowl for whatever reason


[07-Aug-21 08:41 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
LOL WHAT
not the horror i was expecting but still horror nevertheless 🥴


[07-Aug-21 08:41 PM] king of cats#9205
and the most "fun" thing he did was a project where people made ovens out of old pizza boxes and tinfoil which is something you can do as a child
the national science bowl stuff is the horror
it lives in my nightmares
everything there was so abstract and weird


[07-Aug-21 08:42 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
strange science project lol
wow you actually kept going to the club after finding out what it was about??


[07-Aug-21 08:42 PM] king of cats#9205
nope
i ditched shortly afterwards despite him trying to get me stay for a bit
ig it had something to do with me being decent at chem + bio but like no way was i going to study some weird abstract stuff when our team was weaksauce
they spent a few months and then went to competition and then lost within the first round


[07-Aug-21 08:43 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
oof rip him but yeah i wouldnt stay if it ended up being so different
welppp not really a surprise ig


[07-Aug-21 08:44 PM] king of cats#9205
apparently the club is still around


[07-Aug-21 08:44 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
oh ! did they improve at all


[07-Aug-21 08:44 PM] king of cats#9205
that i don't know
i highly doubt they went too far in the competition though
there were a lot of other school within our bracket that could easily beat them out
the only two extracurriculars at my school that were clubs and actually good at what they did would be mock trial and robotics
in my sophomore year the school's mock trial went to state, i think
and robotics went to worlds in texas


[07-Aug-21 08:46 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
the only two extracurriculars at my school that were clubs and actually good at what they did would be mock trial and robotics
ohh yeah our school didnt have actual good academic clubs bc the math or quizbowl or whatverver didnt really end up working out

[07-Aug-21 08:47 PM] king of cats#9205
i think the only other club i can remember being relatively remarkable was the math & physics tutoring club
but yeah, most of the clubs at my school were random though i think we had an esports club
and we had a nintendo club for one year


[07-Aug-21 08:48 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
oh wow people have the weirdest things
omg
i think one year some dudes made a kendama club
do you even remember those things :')))


[07-Aug-21 08:48 PM] king of cats#9205
oml thoseeee
weren't they popular in elementary school?
that was sooooo long ago i swear


[07-Aug-21 08:49 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
for us i think it was a 7th grade phase
omg elem school was rainbow look and those weird circle coin game things you flipped
forgot the name tho
oml rainbow loom?
that's been so longggggggggg


[07-Aug-21 08:50 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
oh yes i make typos all the time if you havent noticed heheh


[07-Aug-21 08:50 PM] king of cats#9205
the only really interesting that happened during my elementary school days was i had a bunch of overnight trips starting in 3rd grade
so i can safely say i've been to a farm and smelled what farm smells like


[07-Aug-21 08:50 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
farms dont smell too good yuck
i dont remember my field trips
we used to go hiking a lot tho and i think rancho san antonio has a farm if you know what that is


[07-Aug-21 08:51 PM] king of cats#9205
i just remember my overnight trips cause i had two each year including my 6th grade


[07-Aug-21 08:51 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
sad moment when my child self was better at walking than me now
ooo nice i think i had overnight for science camp


[07-Aug-21 08:51 PM] king of cats#9205
i actually kinda know where that is


[07-Aug-21 08:51 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
and i also had school retreats so those were overnight


[07-Aug-21 08:51 PM] king of cats#9205
i used to have beach trips for three years straight
we'd camp somewhere and then go to the beach during the day
it was during the fall, around october-november i think when we'd go
so it was cold as heckkkkk


[07-Aug-21 08:52 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
i do not like camping bc of the bugs lmao i get bitten so much


[07-Aug-21 08:52 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
oh yeah beach is fun on warm days


[07-Aug-21 08:52 PM] king of cats#9205
omg i hate camping for that same reason


[07-Aug-21 08:52 PM] king of cats#9205
i remember my 4th grade trip was gold country so we went to somewhere in norcal


[07-Aug-21 08:53 PM] king of cats#9205
no wait


[07-Aug-21 08:53 PM] king of cats#9205
that was my 5th grade 2nd overnight


[07-Aug-21 08:53 PM] king of cats#9205
my fourth grade's non-beach trip was the one where we went to mendocino


[07-Aug-21 08:53 PM] king of cats#9205
and the car ride suckedddddddddddd


[07-Aug-21 08:53 PM] king of cats#9205
i think everyone got slightly carsick


[07-Aug-21 08:53 PM] king of cats#9205
and we lived in cabins in the woods and there were bugs


[07-Aug-21 08:53 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
ahhh yeah i used to get super carsick so it was bad


[07-Aug-21 08:53 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
yuck


[07-Aug-21 08:53 PM] king of cats#9205
and i saw a banana slug and screamed


[07-Aug-21 08:53 PM] king of cats#9205
ahahah


[07-Aug-21 08:54 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
omg people used to lick those things


[07-Aug-21 08:54 PM] king of cats#9205
and kiss them


[07-Aug-21 08:54 PM] king of cats#9205
and i'd just stare at them grossed out


[07-Aug-21 08:54 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
if i expect to see one, they dont rly creep me out too much but theyre still so strange


[07-Aug-21 08:54 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
its so nasty


[07-Aug-21 08:54 PM] king of cats#9205
and there were also creeks and people would really play in them even though there were water skeeters on the water


[07-Aug-21 08:54 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
YUCK


[07-Aug-21 08:54 PM] king of cats#9205
my hatred for banana slugs is exactly why i couldn't attend ucsc ahahah


[07-Aug-21 08:55 PM] king of cats#9205
although it wasn't as bad as the invitation i got last year from  a school whose mascot was a spider


[07-Aug-21 08:55 PM] king of cats#9205

and then there's another uc with a dude who has a big cheesy grin


[07-Aug-21 08:57 PM] king of cats#9205

[07-Aug-21 08:58 PM] jennosaur♡#5678

[07-Aug-21 08:59 PM] king of cats#9205

[07-Aug-21 08:59 PM] king of cats#9205

[07-Aug-21 08:59 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
ahhhh yeah omg even for my friends who left to go to a diff high school, we kinda lost touch after a while


[07-Aug-21 08:59 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
and we still all live in the same area...


[07-Aug-21 09:00 PM] jennosaur♡#5678

[07-Aug-21 09:00 PM] king of cats#9205

[07-Aug-21 09:00 PM] king of cats#9205

[07-Aug-21 09:01 PM] king of cats#9205
same


[07-Aug-21 09:01 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
literally the opposite side of the country but further up :(


[07-Aug-21 09:01 PM] king of cats#9205

[07-Aug-21 09:01 PM] king of cats#9205
so i just found that out now ahahahh


[07-Aug-21 09:01 PM] king of cats#9205
but it's all good


[07-Aug-21 09:02 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
my geo sucks too


[07-Aug-21 09:02 PM] king of cats#9205

[07-Aug-21 09:02 PM] king of cats#9205
that's super coollllllllllll


[07-Aug-21 09:02 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
thats a fun reason to go visit LOL


[07-Aug-21 09:02 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
mhm well shes an online friend but still hehe i doubt we'll ever meet


[07-Aug-21 09:02 PM] king of cats#9205
i have a bunch


[07-Aug-21 09:03 PM] king of cats#9205
and i usually stop talking to them after a while which is sad


[07-Aug-21 09:03 PM] king of cats#9205
buuuut i don't think that's gonna happen with my guild because i really don't stop talking


[07-Aug-21 09:03 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
yeahhh that happens for me with so many people and i dont even know why it always ends up being that way


[07-Aug-21 09:03 PM] king of cats#9205
time zones really mess things up though


[07-Aug-21 09:03 PM] king of cats#9205
cause some of my friends are in se asia or something


[07-Aug-21 09:03 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
oo nice :)) it always sucks to drift away


[07-Aug-21 09:03 PM] king of cats#9205
fr f r


[07-Aug-21 09:04 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
oh yeah thats yet another reason i stay up late... bc some of them are only online then


[07-Aug-21 09:04 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
i basically live in taiwan timezone a lot of the time during summer LOL thats the excuse i use when my parents find me awake when they wake up


[07-Aug-21 09:05 PM] king of cats#9205
my mom always tells me my time is upside down in chinese


[07-Aug-21 09:05 PM] king of cats#9205
and like honestly, yeah


[07-Aug-21 09:05 PM] king of cats#9205
i do tend to have my times flipped


[07-Aug-21 09:05 PM] king of cats#9205
i have a friend in taiwan but i also don't talk to her much ahahah


[07-Aug-21 09:05 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
ahahah just gettin ready to go on vacay to asia :))


[07-Aug-21 09:06 PM] king of cats#9205
oml yesssssssssssss


[07-Aug-21 09:06 PM] king of cats#9205
i wanna go to japan


[07-Aug-21 09:06 PM] king of cats#9205
everything looks so pretty there


[07-Aug-21 09:06 PM] king of cats#9205
especially the food


[07-Aug-21 09:06 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
ah yeah i dont think i actively talk to anyone who lives there


[07-Aug-21 09:06 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
YES SAME


[07-Aug-21 09:06 PM] king of cats#9205
honestly now i have an actual reason to be up at odd hours since some of my friends from my guild like haikyuu and they're in a diff timezone


[07-Aug-21 09:06 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
but it would be so hard to figure out stuff especially if i got lost or something lol


[07-Aug-21 09:07 PM] king of cats#9205
fr fr


[07-Aug-21 09:07 PM] king of cats#9205
which is exactly why i should learn some japanese


[07-Aug-21 09:07 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
timezones are always so annyoing but also a good excuse :)


[07-Aug-21 09:07 PM] king of cats#9205
y e s


[07-Aug-21 09:07 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
have you picked up any japanese from animes?


[07-Aug-21 09:08 PM] king of cats#9205
i picked up more japanese from the japanese medical tv show i watch than i do from animes, oddly enough


[07-Aug-21 09:08 PM] king of cats#9205
whenever i watch animes i usually just end up remembering what the subs say, not the actual japanese lmfao


[07-Aug-21 09:08 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
oh i think reality/variety shows are usually better for learning because people speak more casually


[07-Aug-21 09:09 PM] king of cats#9205
definitely


[07-Aug-21 09:09 PM] king of cats#9205
especially since haikyuu has some dialects


[07-Aug-21 09:09 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
thats me w kdramas lolll sometimes i basically end up reading it as a novel with a blur of movement in the back


[07-Aug-21 09:09 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
oh rly?


[07-Aug-21 09:09 PM] king of cats#9205
like the miya twins speak in i think the kansai dialect


[07-Aug-21 09:09 PM] king of cats#9205
so they kinda speak a bit different


[07-Aug-21 09:10 PM] king of cats#9205
i picked up a bit of korean from binging an idol competition or something


[07-Aug-21 09:10 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
TIL that japanese has dialects ahaahah im not surprised but i never realized


[07-Aug-21 09:10 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
oh what show? i think i only know produce c ampfor k-tv shows


[07-Aug-21 09:10 PM] king of cats#9205
although i knew how to say good morning cause i had a teacher in elementary school who liked to have people do good mornings in different languages so everyone learned something new ig


[07-Aug-21 09:10 PM] king of cats#9205
i watched the unit, not produce 101 lmao


[07-Aug-21 09:11 PM] king of cats#9205
i don't know how i got into it, but i ended up hooked


[07-Aug-21 09:11 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
oh thats fun!


[07-Aug-21 09:11 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
never heard of that show lol but its always amazing to find something so random that you end up loving


[07-Aug-21 09:11 PM] king of cats#9205
yesssssssssssss


[07-Aug-21 09:12 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
like i was this close to having that never be a part of my life but nopee


[07-Aug-21 09:12 PM] king of cats#9205
lmaooooooo


[07-Aug-21 09:12 PM] king of cats#9205
i feel like sometimes you don't mean to enjoy something as much as you do


[07-Aug-21 09:12 PM] king of cats#9205
but then when you find out it's just hard to stop


[07-Aug-21 09:13 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
yesshhs and yay more ruined sleep LOL


[07-Aug-21 09:13 PM] king of cats#9205
i remember i had this phase where i thought premed and neurosurgery was so cool


[07-Aug-21 09:13 PM] king of cats#9205
and then i read when breath becomes air


[07-Aug-21 09:13 PM] king of cats#9205
and it was so sad but i liked it so much? so i bought a copy


[07-Aug-21 09:13 PM] king of cats#9205

[07-Aug-21 09:14 PM] king of cats#9205

honestly i really enjoyed it


[07-Aug-21 09:15 PM] jennosaur♡#5678

[07-Aug-21 09:16 PM] king of cats#9205

[07-Aug-21 09:16 PM] king of cats#9205
my priorities are so whacked out


[07-Aug-21 09:16 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
my memory is actually too bad o gosh i just know it was those series that people would talk about in middle school lol


[07-Aug-21 09:16 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
omg i havent seen streams in too long i didnt realize that was happening


[07-Aug-21 09:17 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
but rip ill be driving back to the bay


[07-Aug-21 09:17 PM] king of cats#9205
i'm honestly excited because i was at his first twitch which happened last month


[07-Aug-21 09:17 PM] king of cats#9205
and it was really fun honestly


[07-Aug-21 09:18 PM] king of cats#9205
although i do hope he finishes resi 8


[07-Aug-21 09:18 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
i only found out that he started on twitch literally last week but im really out of the loop now and streams take so long to watch so 😭


[07-Aug-21 09:18 PM] king of cats#9205
yeah they really do


[07-Aug-21 09:18 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
ah yes the horror game lol


[07-Aug-21 09:18 PM] king of cats#9205
some of them are soooo long


[07-Aug-21 09:18 PM] king of cats#9205
it was like 4-5 hours of streaming  i think


[07-Aug-21 09:18 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
i used to binge watch streams on 2x after the vods were posted


[07-Aug-21 09:18 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
it was bad


[07-Aug-21 09:18 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
basically hapepend all of december which was LITERALLY COLLEGE APP SEASON


[07-Aug-21 09:19 PM] king of cats#9205
oml college app season ahahahahahahahah


[07-Aug-21 09:19 PM] king of cats#9205
mine was such a disaster


[07-Aug-21 09:19 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
i really didnt start common app til 2021


[07-Aug-21 09:19 PM] king of cats#9205
i honestly just read manga instead of writing my supps


[07-Aug-21 09:19 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
ignore that my first commonapp deadline was on either the 1st or 2nd


[07-Aug-21 09:19 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
ah that was me with streams lol


[07-Aug-21 09:19 PM] king of cats#9205
omllllllllll that's wild
i don't even know how i survived last year


[07-Aug-21 09:20 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
im such a bad influence lol some 22 kilds asked me about apps and i was like DONT DO WHAT I DID
i didnt think enough about college to care too much about apps and thats why on the day the uc was due, i was frantically looking for any major to put in lol


[07-Aug-21 09:20 PM] king of cats#9205
ahahah my mom is the one who handles the questions
but i also wasn't close with any of my underclassmen so no one asks me about stuff like that
the only app essays i'll be looking at are my other childhood friend's essays, maybe and that's cause he's the son of my mom's bestie from high school
at least for this season


[07-Aug-21 09:22 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
ah yeah im not rly close with any but a few in my classes asked
i highly doubt ill read over anyones apps
i had no clue what i was doing myself


[07-Aug-21 09:22 PM] king of cats#9205
i read so many  fanfics that i know what bad storytelling sounds like


[07-Aug-21 09:23 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
oh i used to read fanfics i had a phase but many just had horrendous grammar


[07-Aug-21 09:23 PM] king of cats#9205
i spent my last year of high school reading manga and fanfics


[07-Aug-21 09:23 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
the only thing i can ado is grammar lol not the actual content


[07-Aug-21 09:23 PM] king of cats#9205
i think it depends on the fandom really, the quality is all over the place


[07-Aug-21 09:23 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
true true


[07-Aug-21 09:23 PM] king of cats#9205
content is the only thing i can actually help with


[07-Aug-21 09:23 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
also some are written by literal kids who dont know what theyre doign and its kinda cringe lmao


[07-Aug-21 09:23 PM] king of cats#9205
yessssssssssss
i will say that tags really cull the herd, that and how they summarize


[07-Aug-21 09:24 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
content is more important tho like you could alwasy get grammarly to check grammar but not content lol


[07-Aug-21 09:24 PM] king of cats#9205
usually you can tell how experienced an author is from the way they summarize, tag and other stuff


[07-Aug-21 09:25 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
oh yeah


[07-Aug-21 09:25 PM] king of cats#9205
the ones who write on tumblr as well as ao3 tend to have better content from what i've noticed
i've also noticed a bunch of wattpad writers tend to like those weird looking fonts


[07-Aug-21 09:25 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
lol kinda hypocritical but if they dont bother to capitalize or punctuate i automatically think itll be bad
oh i litearlly havent been on tumblr i dont get how it works


[07-Aug-21 09:25 PM] king of cats#9205
honestly i have seen some decent all lowercase fics
i don't usually go on tumblr either ahahah


[07-Aug-21 09:26 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
i didnt even know wattpad had fonts but i havent been on in years
i think it got really annoying to use


[07-Aug-21 09:26 PM] king of cats#9205
i mean they don't
somehow they have these html copy paste ones


[07-Aug-21 09:26 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
true i think ive read some but it really depends on how they summarize or how the first part is


[07-Aug-21 09:26 PM] king of cats#9205
yessssssssssssssss


[07-Aug-21 09:26 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
oh hmm id ont think ive noticed that?? kinda forgot tbh


[07-Aug-21 09:27 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
shoot forgot i was gonna work on aps LOL i think im gonna go do that rn :')


[07-Aug-21 09:27 PM] king of cats#9205
oml sameeeeeeee


[07-Aug-21 09:28 PM] king of cats#9205
i gotta wrap that up


[07-Aug-21 09:28 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
i know i left the parts i thought were harder


[07-Aug-21 09:28 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
so hopefully it isnt too bad but


[07-Aug-21 09:29 PM] king of cats#9205
i mean


[07-Aug-21 09:29 PM] king of cats#9205
it's not graded lmaooooooo


[07-Aug-21 09:29 PM] king of cats#9205
i'm just going to answer with whatever comes out of my brain


[07-Aug-21 09:34 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
ok true im very glad it isnt because tbh my descriptions sound very wonky and nonacademic LOL


[07-Aug-21 09:34 PM] king of cats#9205
ngl i'm approaching it the same way i approach essays


[07-Aug-21 09:35 PM] king of cats#9205
i just write without too much thought and usually things make lots of sense


[07-Aug-21 09:35 PM] king of cats#9205
now i'm kinda curious, are you the type of person who plans out an essay or one who just writes one without any planning or outlining?


[07-Aug-21 09:35 PM] king of cats#9205
actually if anyone else wants to answer this question, please do


[07-Aug-21 09:37 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
i usually just write because planning takes me too much time and id rather use that time writing lmaoo


[07-Aug-21 09:37 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
maybe my brain can subconsciously think while im writing the intro para and if it isnt thinking well, at least i can rest my hand while thinking instead of writing consecutively


[07-Aug-21 09:38 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
also when i plan i change it half the time anyways


[07-Aug-21 09:38 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
is anyone else here :((((


[07-Aug-21 09:46 PM] king of cats#9205
yeah!!! is anyone else here??? ;w;


[07-Aug-21 09:47 PM] king of cats#9205
s a m e
my brain does it fine as i'm working through the essay and it sounds so much more cohesive than it would if i was trying to hit all the points i planned out


[07-Aug-21 09:50 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
exactly! well at least i think thats how it works for me


[07-Aug-21 09:51 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
also random q uhh do you have the file from niema's lecture? the one where he wrote out some stuff related to this assignemnt


[07-Aug-21 09:51 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
i have it but my laptop cant open it and i wanted to use it as reference:/


[07-Aug-21 09:54 PM] king of cats#9205
did you mean the aps discussion yesterday? if so i didn't download any files, i just wrote down what was relevant to the questions and that was it lmao


[07-Aug-21 09:56 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
ahh i remember he sent whatever he wrote on the whiteboard in chat but the file type (1a) is so strange


[07-Aug-21 09:56 PM] king of cats#9205
yeah sometimes you end up needing some weird thing to open files


[07-Aug-21 09:56 PM] king of cats#9205
i also noticed sometimes the files end up downloaded or uploaded as weird files


[07-Aug-21 09:57 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
i litearlly just tried downloading a file viewer but it failed lmao


[07-Aug-21 09:57 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
mhm i usually would screenshot but i forgot to figure out how to do this on my new laptop 🤡

[07-Aug-21 09:58 PM] king of cats#9205
oml i had to set up snagit on this laptop since it's new
the one i was going to buy still hasn't been released yet so this is my interim laptop ahahah


[07-Aug-21 09:58 PM] king of cats#9205
i mean i also have the stuff he said about 1b + 1c


[07-Aug-21 10:00 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
OH i just googled smth that helped but unfortunately it isnt what i expected it to be so the actual file was usless lmaooo


[07-Aug-21 10:00 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
yeah i just got this lpaotp too and im used to mac controls since our school laptops were macbooks


[07-Aug-21 10:01 PM] king of cats#9205
yeah the windows computers have this built in screenshotter known as snipping tool


[07-Aug-21 10:01 PM] king of cats#9205
but i find it kinda tiring to use since i don't think it has a hotkey


[07-Aug-21 10:01 PM] king of cats#9205
so i had my dad download snagit since it lets me set a hotkey


[07-Aug-21 10:02 PM] king of cats#9205

mhm but now since ive forgotten math, i forgot how to write functions :')


[07-Aug-21 10:05 PM] king of cats#9205
functions like math functions


[07-Aug-21 10:05 PM] king of cats#9205
or functions like programming functions


[07-Aug-21 10:06 PM] king of cats#9205
i still kinda remember math functions


[07-Aug-21 10:11 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
oh yeah i mean math functions right now like how we need to write an equation as a function of *n* lmao


[07-Aug-21 10:13 PM] king of cats#9205
do we actually?


[07-Aug-21 10:13 PM] king of cats#9205

[07-Aug-21 11:49 PM] jennosaur♡#5678

[07-Aug-21 11:49 PM] king of cats#9205
lewis capaldi

[07-Aug-21 11:50 PM] king of cats#9205
wait jenny have you heard some of the unreleased ed sheeran stuff?


[07-Aug-21 11:50 PM] jennosaur♡#5678

[07-Aug-21 11:50 PM] king of cats#9205

[07-Aug-21 11:51 PM] jennosaur♡#5678

[07-Aug-21 11:51 PM] king of cats#9205
which suckssssssssss


[07-Aug-21 11:51 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
i think the only unreleased songs i can think of are miss you and something about cutting your hair idr 😩


[07-Aug-21 11:51 PM] king of cats#9205
but i only really keep up with corpse at this point lmfao


[07-Aug-21 11:51 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
ahhhh yeah sometimes i download local files but theyre all gone now since new laptop


[07-Aug-21 11:52 PM] king of cats#9205
man new laptops are such a pain


[07-Aug-21 11:52 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
i see i see but tbh many corpse songs are too intense for me


[07-Aug-21 11:52 PM] king of cats#9205
so glad my dad loaded all the important stuff of mine onto a hardrive


[07-Aug-21 11:52 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
fr!! but my school one was basically dead


[07-Aug-21 11:52 PM] king of cats#9205
that is so fairrrrrrrrrrr


[07-Aug-21 11:52 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
:oo i was too lazy to do that


[07-Aug-21 11:52 PM] king of cats#9205
lmao


[07-Aug-21 11:52 PM] king of cats#9205
but yeah i def get corpse being intense


[07-Aug-21 11:52 PM] king of cats#9205
i think his least intense song is probably agoraphobic


[07-Aug-21 11:53 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
mhm i rly like his voice but now i usually like softer songs


[07-Aug-21 11:53 PM] king of cats#9205
although he does have new stuff coming sometime


[07-Aug-21 11:53 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
yeahhh ive listened to that one a few  times


[07-Aug-21 11:53 PM] king of cats#9205
soft songs are so niceeeee


[07-Aug-21 11:53 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
oo ok i like taking a listen in case theres smth i can vibe w lol


[07-Aug-21 11:53 PM] king of cats#9205
i think i found most of my soft songs from one of those remix youtube channels


[07-Aug-21 11:53 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
yes yes i think i realizd my fav genre is something i made up but wtv i call it melancholic ballads LOL


[07-Aug-21 11:54 PM] king of cats#9205
lmao ballads


[07-Aug-21 11:54 PM] king of cats#9205
i have this really random taste


[07-Aug-21 11:54 PM] king of cats#9205
at first it'll be k/da or something and then musicals and then sea shanties


[07-Aug-21 11:54 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
omg k/da lol


[07-Aug-21 11:55 PM] king of cats#9205
okay but if you're into like bass singers


[07-Aug-21 11:55 PM] king of cats#9205
i have a rec, he does covers on youtube


[07-Aug-21 11:55 PM] king of cats#9205
and his bass is quite nice


[07-Aug-21 11:55 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
yeah i think my taste is kinda random bc i do kinda listen all over the place


[07-Aug-21 11:55 PM] king of cats#9205
not like corpse deep


[07-Aug-21 11:55 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
:o who?


[07-Aug-21 11:55 PM] king of cats#9205
colm mcguinness?


[07-Aug-21 11:56 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
he looks familiar i feel like i mightve seen a vid before


[07-Aug-21 11:56 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
but i dont usually find new music on youtube


[07-Aug-21 11:56 PM] king of cats#9205
i got a little too into sea shanties cause i was listening to reinaery


[07-Aug-21 11:56 PM] king of cats#9205
and then he showed up


[07-Aug-21 11:57 PM] king of cats#9205
i mean i learned a few on guitar years ago and wanted the nostalgia and then i got hooked to the bass


[07-Aug-21 11:57 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
ive never heard of sea shanties lol


[07-Aug-21 11:57 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
ohhh that makes sense


[07-Aug-21 11:58 PM] jennosaur♡#5678
omg i just searched it and drunken sailor is such a throwback that song makes me laugh


[07-Aug-21 11:58 PM] king of cats#9205
i swear that song reminds me of my 6th grade days


[07-Aug-21 11:59 PM] king of cats#9205
and then country roads & green day's boulevard of broken dreams is elementary school


[07-Aug-21 11:59 PM] jennosaur♡#5678

[07-Aug-21 11:59 PM] king of cats#9205

[07-Aug-21 11:59 PM] king of cats#9205
i used to have to wake up so early for that


[08-Aug-21 12:00 AM] king of cats#9205
i remember we sang once upon a december from anastasia once


[08-Aug-21 12:00 AM] king of cats#9205
and back when 1D was getting huge, we sang a song from them


[08-Aug-21 12:00 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
ohhhh ok


[08-Aug-21 12:00 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
wait yeah so many elem school things were BEFORE school which is so </3


[08-Aug-21 12:00 AM] king of cats#9205
and we sang the christmas in whoville thing though i think we messed that one up a bunch during practice


[08-Aug-21 12:00 AM] king of cats#9205
i knowwww


[08-Aug-21 12:00 AM] king of cats#9205
it's so weird thinking about how i willingly woke up early


[08-Aug-21 12:01 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
tbh i didnt know 1D til they disbanded bc so many classmates were dying during 7th grade about that band


[08-Aug-21 12:01 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
LOL fr i dont think i did it willingly tho


[08-Aug-21 12:01 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
parents probably made me


[08-Aug-21 12:01 AM] king of cats#9205
ahahahah


[08-Aug-21 12:01 AM] king of cats#9205
i don't remember why i did it


[08-Aug-21 12:01 AM] king of cats#9205
but we did sing a disney song


[08-Aug-21 12:01 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
oo fun


[08-Aug-21 12:02 AM] king of cats#9205
omg i knew about 1D only cause we had to sing one of their songs and the daughter of the mom in charge of choir loved the band ig


[08-Aug-21 12:02 AM] king of cats#9205
which is how it ended up on our song lineup


[08-Aug-21 12:02 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
thats kinda funny lmaoo choir singing 1D would normally seems trange


[08-Aug-21 12:02 AM] king of cats#9205
we sang it during springtime or something


[08-Aug-21 12:03 AM] king of cats#9205
i think it was "that's what makes you beautiful"


[08-Aug-21 12:03 AM] king of cats#9205
lmfao


[08-Aug-21 12:03 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
oh gosh of course

[08-Aug-21 12:06 AM] king of cats#9205

[08-Aug-21 12:06 AM] king of cats#9205

[08-Aug-21 12:06 AM] king of cats#9205
i-


[08-Aug-21 12:07 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
yep yep litearlly yesterdays whole convo just further proved this smh


[08-Aug-21 12:07 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
ig technically the day before yesterday


[08-Aug-21 12:07 AM] king of cats#9205
yeah technicallyyyy but also technicalities are kinda eh


[08-Aug-21 12:08 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
agreed lmao


[08-Aug-21 12:09 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
the only times i regonizie smth technical is when its past midnight and i reference the days wrong


[08-Aug-21 12:09 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
ugh idek how to word that


[08-Aug-21 12:09 AM] king of cats#9205
honestly
i just considering morning whenever i wake up
:p
also like yeah, idk what it is with school and sketchy things lmfao


[08-Aug-21 12:09 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
me too and people are like... no you sleep in the morning


[08-Aug-21 12:09 AM] king of cats#9205
n o
it's always whenever you wakeup
cause it's morning somewhere else in the world aaaaaaaa


[08-Aug-21 12:10 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
yesssss because people dont rly call 12 am daytime so there isnt even a set thing anyways!


[08-Aug-21 12:10 AM] king of cats#9205
jenny did you got to a public school or a private school?
i swear most people i know always shit on private schools lmfao


[08-Aug-21 12:11 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
oh i went to priv starting in 6th


[08-Aug-21 12:11 AM] king of cats#9205
oh wow that's pretty cool!!!


[08-Aug-21 12:11 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
tbh i just say tuition isnt worth but im not mad my family sent me there lol


[08-Aug-21 12:11 AM] king of cats#9205
i think it really depends on the school tbh


[08-Aug-21 12:11 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
the admin did many questionable things tbh but its not like publics were better


[08-Aug-21 12:12 AM] king of cats#9205
that's also a good point
like i remember people saying that harker was an academically strong private school


[08-Aug-21 12:12 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
so many ppl in our school hated it tho because i went to a chrisitan school and many staff are old white males who lean very right


[08-Aug-21 12:12 AM] king of cats#9205
ohhhhhhhhhhhh
that is indeed a very awkward thing
i had a friend who went a catholic school and was like "i learned almost no science"


[08-Aug-21 12:13 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
mhm mhm they pushed a lot of beliefs on people and there were a lot of controversial talks
ah yeah i think the biggest thing is evolution


[08-Aug-21 12:13 AM] king of cats#9205
yeah evolution is controversial, don't some states refuse to teach it?


[08-Aug-21 12:14 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
we wer etaught the diff perspectives but it wasnt like unscientific at the same time and most other stuff was normal i guess
but our teacher basically taught it and leaned twd evolution lol but its not like we were graded on what we believed in
i know some teachers are like you better have my opinion or else you fail


[08-Aug-21 12:14 AM] king of cats#9205
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh i felt that
i've had teachers like that and they are so difficult


[08-Aug-21 12:15 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
yeahhh those teachers are irritating


[08-Aug-21 12:15 AM] king of cats#9205
i think i pissed off my 9th grade advisory teacher that way lmfao


[08-Aug-21 12:15 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
most of mine werent like that though which i thought was nice

[08-Aug-21 12:15 AM] king of cats#9205
i don't feel sorry at all though
i think he was a bit backwards to begin with


[08-Aug-21 12:16 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
i dont actually know what advisory teachers do but he probably deserved it 😩


[08-Aug-21 12:16 AM] king of cats#9205
he was just supposed to help us get oriented during the first month of school
and i may or may not have said some interesting things that made him speechless


[08-Aug-21 12:17 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
oh lmaoo did he not experience people who disagreed w him before or smth


[08-Aug-21 12:17 AM] king of cats#9205
well
i think it'll make more sense if i just say what happened


[08-Aug-21 12:19 AM] king of cats#9205
so he was talking about manners and stuff because i guess that's something he found really important and he was telling us about dating etiquette and i was like okay whatever
but my friend (the one who attended a catholic school & is going to u of t) and i were kinda just semi paying attention until he said something like "guys if a girl laughs at your jokes, it means they like you"
it was his fault for what happened afterwards cause he added a "right ladies?"
and i just lost it, i started laughing and he looked at me funny and asked if i had anything to say, and i said yeah sure i did 
and i told him "well, they could also feel bad for you"
yeah and he stared at me flabbergasted as my friend and i burst into another round of hysterical laughter
and we never saw him again since advisory ended that day


[08-Aug-21 12:21 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
LOL WHAT first of all thats a strange thing to say to a group of students but ok
yes go tel him the facts and i love that he just disappeared afaeirgg


[08-Aug-21 12:21 AM] king of cats#9205
ahahahahah he didn't disappear
we just never had to see him again cause advisory was over
i think since that day he never liked me as a student again though i'd never know cause he wasn't my english teacher


[08-Aug-21 12:22 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
ohhh well thats a nice last impression you made :D
ahahaha i feel like if you had him as a teacher he would just feel awkward seeing you


[08-Aug-21 12:23 AM] king of cats#9205
lmfao it's one of the few times when i regret nothing
he was backwards in that sense and honestly it was kinda weird
i don't think people have to laugh with you, sometimes they can laugh at you
so hearing that was just weirdly very funny


[08-Aug-21 12:24 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
mhm definitely i also just cringe hearing people give advice like that in the first place and i wish i could retort half the time


[08-Aug-21 12:24 AM] king of cats#9205
sometimes i do it without thinking
i mean in that situation i didn't have a choice cause everyone was staring lmfao
but still i think there are def times it's better to say nothing


[08-Aug-21 12:25 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
i only have smart retorts if its w ppl im already pretty close with bc otherwise i probably wouldnt be talking


[08-Aug-21 12:25 AM] king of cats#9205
it takes so long to think of good ones


[08-Aug-21 12:25 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
lol i bet the other ppl there were glad you said that


[08-Aug-21 12:26 AM] king of cats#9205
perhaps lmfao
at the very least, it made for an interesting final advisory


[08-Aug-21 12:26 AM] jennosaur♡#5678
ahhh yes sometimes i think of good ones a literal day later completely randomly


[08-Aug-21 12:27 AM] king of cats#9205
i feel like since it takes so long to come up with retorts, i usually just end up saying exactly what i'm thinking
and then things like that happen

i think the few times i *tried* to say what i was thinking just ended up so awkward and i just wanna go hide in a hole

there are times i strongly regret not saying something and being like "ur wrong"
that's such a mood though
wanting to say something and then panicking and changing it midway through

oh that happens to me way more but i think sometimes i just lose hope in ppl and just dont even try anymore if they say too many strange things that make no sense to me
and half the time i say words that dont exist bc i combine 2 words-
