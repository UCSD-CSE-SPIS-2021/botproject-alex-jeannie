is anyone else wondering how in the world they're going to wake up before focs tomorrow? my sleep schedule is such a mess lmao
ahahah that's a great point
but staying up late is wayyy too enjoyable lmao
ahahahah thank you, i'll try not to snooze :p
early classes suck when they're in person because when it's morning during like winter, it's cold
and if it's online, it's so easy to sleep through lmfao
update: i woke up just fine idk what i was worried about lmao
^^^
is having prothit's vc visible to everyone intentional, if not the perms got messed up b/c i can see it and it doesn't have the lock icon on it
ohhhh
i finished my hw lmao
i don't even have a specific time? i just have a range of time apparently
i have a 9pm time
i have 9pm on the 19th lmao
lmaoooo
oh wow those are cute pins!!!
i know a few people in our group thought that maybe doing a bit later in the session would have been better since it's only been a few days since we met everyone lmao
yeah :3
thisssssssssssss
@NewtonC re: gradescope account
you should have gotten an email from your personal email, not the ucsd one that has a link for you to reset the password
it was sent out yesterday i think [edit: sorry, two days ago]
no problem! :3
does anyone read haikyuu because i found a picture of bokuto from the manga that applies to learning how to program, among other things that require some degree of studying :3
üèê (3) 
‚ù§Ô∏è 
okay but like i just remembered that one scene where bokuto tells tsukishima that the reason why he doesn't really like volleyball is because he sucks
üíØ 
do you all have any hobbies? idk it's 10 pm and i kinda wanna talk but also idk what to talk about lmao
oh that's super cool!!!
i knew someone who was big on cosplay and they sell their stuff on depop
lmao in terms of hobbies i would probably say that ao3 is my biggest hobby besides reading an obscene amount of manga
i have a bunch of smaller ones that i sometimes forget and sometimes remember ahahah
so, how has your day been?
it really does
oh that does sound really niceeeee
hope you have a nice day at work!!!
like tomorrow
wow that's pretty long
hi sam! :3
lmao my parents were like if it wasn't for spis we could have taken you to santa cruz
but yes spis first because i really haven't been hanging out with people
ye s
bay area
san jose
‚ÄºÔ∏è 
wait fr
what high school
ohhhh i had a childhood friend at that school
i'm at prospect
i had a few old classmates who went from my elementary
& then i had a childhood friend
weird i actually forgot their names
i just know that they went to lynbrook ahahah
but my childhood friend was the quarterback
that's what i remember my mom telling me that his mom told her
ahahahaha ours too
legit we only started winning once our team dropped like 1 or two leagues
the only good sports we have are like swimming and maybe cross country and track
lmaooooo
i played sports for 2 years to get out of pe my second year
can't relate
i remember trying cross country in 6th grade, finding out it was long distance and promising myself i'd never torture myself like that again
then i did it again in sophomore year
we had a pe teacher who hated guys for whatever reason
my pe teacher was pregnant and the sub liked me which meant i was tortured
ü•≤ 
wait yes, spill :3
oh shit we had a soccer coach date a student
oof i mean i also have tea on not just my school, but the whole district :p
whoaaaa that's wild
lmaoooo one of my friends was like that
and then i ended up in a massive thing with the superintendent and my high school
‚ÄºÔ∏è (2) 
so full story?
so only like this may our school came under massive fire online about how they kept mishandling sexual harassment at school
a lot of people were calling out the school for not doing anything like my friend knew this dude dating a middle schooler
and then my school had plenty of evidence that me and like two other girls at the school dated an abusive creep who should not have been allowed back on campus
but funny thing was that when i reached out to the school and was like hi this guy is a danger to students at the school
they ignored the email and the person in charge of handling it yelled at the youngest person involved
said something like i should not have contacted them about the issue with the guy
and so i escalated it to the district and emailed the superintendent
caused a whole emergency meeting at my high school and then nothing happened
he graduated like nothing happened
i saw him at the awards
there were a bunch of complaints against other students as well that apparently the school did nothing about
the only time school actually did something was when there was a case on campus where they had a bunch of people who took videos or something on snapchat cause it was in the bathrooms at school
but idk it's a public school
oh it was a sexual assault thing
i guess some people recorded it
the most recent picture of our school, and i'm not kidding, is literally from a mercury news article about our school having a jv soccer coach who dated a student
i think there's no reputation left
ew there was a guy like that in my grade who apparently sent a bunch of girls unsolicited pictures during freshman year
they just cover their eyes
and run
i-
facts
how hard is it to keep your hands to yourself i-
honestly i just remembered how much worse that situation was
i had proof the guy took inappropriate pictures of the freshman he had been dating and i‚Äôm pretty sure he kept them but ig school didn‚Äôt care but it‚Äôs illegal
he also contacted me a year later and sent me his contact info for whatever reason which was creepy af
every school everrrr
Ew 
even my middle school did that
nah that thing with the superintendent apparently didn‚Äôt work even with a parent involved
i wonder when they're going to have bright idea to actually do something
like i remember schools saying don't be a bystander and then they are though
it took an instagram page calling them out and publishing stories from people for the school to even address it and all they did was say that they were doing everything they could :p
but they were more than happy to take someone off campus in cuffs for drug dealing apparently
y e s
and then they do that speech where they say something like "we're going to make the school better"
but they only meant the buildings
oml yeahhhhh
i swear schools are proud of the weirdest things
for example, why do they have a special trophy for the students with all as at the end of their high school career?
omg yes and then they're like mEnTaL hEaLtH
but then they also have those counselors who you can't really be too sure about
one of my friends had the counselor call cps on their parents even though it wasn't abuse
like counselor just decided to call cps
i-
idk but we got a new one shortly afterwards
did you all have a favorite teacher at school who wasn't bad like the rest of a mess school was?
lmao i changed from my high school to a different program halfway through
yeah i went from high school to high school-community college
pretty much i went to middle college
so i have like 90 units already done
you can see it on the degree audit!
i keep getting transfer emails but idk if that's because of my 90 units or because it just happens
right and then you're like what do you wanttttttttt
i'm dreading foreign language cause i took a placement test for spanish after two years of not studying it
and i still don't know my results :3
i didn't take the ap so i'm living in regret
like i probably should have either taken the ap test or the subject test
my mom really said that if i didn't do well on my spanish placement i might as well do chinese
but i kinda forgot how to read & write
i knowwww, i kept joking about how people would probably be so confused as to why i can speak fine but can't seem to read or write
oooh alex, do you have any favorite shows?
HAIKYUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUu
oh that is such a relief
alexxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
my entire brain has been running on haikyuu
RIGHT?
did you read the manga?
the boys didn't just grow up, they glowed up
honestly it's such an amazing ending
i was so sad when japan didn't take the chance to use haikyuu to get people interested in the olympics
ahhhhhhhhhhhh sameeeeeeeeee
i wanna watch it
like reading it was nice
but watching it hits different
do you remember that scene where bokuto tells tsukki that he probably sucks at volleyball?
i was like but why does that apply to coding too
i could hear bokuto saying that
and now i can't unhear it
i knowwwwwwwww
he really grew upppppp
ahhhhhh i was crying non stop
and when seijoh lost i was also crying
ahhhhhhhhhhhh oml
i also loved kyotani's scenes
it was hilarious watching him ram kindaichi out of the way
yeahhhh
i wanted to see kiyoomi in action though
i was so happy seeing suna in s4 clips ngl
i hope they do a season where they've grown up
because i really need that
like clumsy lev ||a model!!!!!!||
i-
it's a spoiler
you tap on it and unspoiler it
i didn't want anyone new to the series to find out
yeah
he and his sis became models
also iwa-chan apparently went to uc irvine
i don't remember if that was a headcanon or fr
yeahhhhhhh
some of them did
ushiwaka & kageyama did
along with a number of other people for the 2020 olympics
I KNOW RIGHT
i would have spent money on haikyuu merch for olypmic theme
they really underestimated the amount of money people would be willing to spend
ye s
i went to asia, specifically taiwan and i bought stickers for haikyuu from there
honestly i wish there were more places to buy stuff here
honestly they shoulddddd
i want more official merch
i have to say the people who make the pins are cool but idk i feel like official is different
i think they do, but as a cosplay jacket
there's also aoba johsai vbc
yeah!!!!
people sell those online
back when i looked it was just aoba johsai, karasuno, nekoma, and shiratorizawa
maybe fukurodani
this was years ago though
i was in 8th grade when i first started watching i think
i swear 8th grade was when everyone wanted to be edgy lmao
i remember memorizing the name of bands and stuff
it was such a weird time
right
wasn't that the same time bts got big?
honestly i remember 8th grade as the time when i think onision was big and so was shane dawson and like that era of youtubers
i knowww and i knew people who watched them religiously
honestly i also remember there being some kind of weirdly popular wattpad fic about brendon urie's forehead or something
probably my friend group then
but i remember they were big on twenty one pilots, fall out boy, my chemical romance, pierce the veil, falling in reverse, black veil brides, sleeping with sirens, panic at the disco, bring me the horizon and like other screamo bands
yeah they were so popular back then
it was so weird hearing p!atd on the radio like years later
honestly some of the people haven't aged at all
lmaooooo
honestly that's so wild
i've just been about the same height since middle school i think
and yeahhhhhhhhh
and now all the children i knew grew
so they call me short
and then i end up being like offended short person noises
i'm 5'3
my brother likes to spite me and say i'm 5'2.5 he just really had to take that half an inch off me
most of the people i meet are taller than me and then they're like wow you're short
and i'm like wow you're tall
‚ÄºÔ∏è 
okay but felt
yessssssssss
okay but same
i drank this weird herbal concoction and hit 5'3
but sleep is like hahah wait why
alex, you shouldddddddddd
cause you have work
okayyyyy good night to youuuuu
yessssssssss :3
umaaaaaaaaaa how has your day been?
it's been long ahahahah but i'm having fun
i singlehandedly managed to get this chat live so i'm happy
fr fr  it was pretty much all day
it's been so nice to actually talk to people
and see faces
ohhhhhhhhhh niceeee
what kind
of cookies
ohhhhhhhhh those are greattttttttt :3
i feel like i've been deprived of social interactions for so long that now i'm overly social
like usually i'm not this talkative
SAME
but i also just don't know how to talk to people
so i get anxious about starting a convo
and then i do it anyway because idk
a quiet chat always kinda bugs me
i blame the guild i joined in a game
same, i'm probably an ambivert leaning towards introvert
it's shining nikki!
it's a newer game from the love nikki series
i kinda started on a whim
but the guild has a discord activity requirement so i started chatting and then i couldn't stop
same
i play all the easy games
like animal crossing pocket camp?
OMG GENSHINNNNNNNN
i was so bad
i couldn't pass that hang glider thingy
i died like thirty times and gave up
yesssssssssssssssssss
i also play fate grand order
but mostly it's my brother who grinds for me while i collect the characters i want
ahahah
honestly i like just watching people play video games
i also like not having to do anything lmao
i was watching a few different streams of resident evil 8 and honestly it was amazing
yeah!!!!
instead you just enjoy the game while they struggle with the stuff
i ended up finding some favorite streamers through that ahahah
corpse_husband mainly ahahahah
yeahhhhhh his voice is really soothing for me
i got into him b/c of the resi 8 stream
i thought it was hilarious
ohhhh that is so cool
he did two
his first was capcom sponsored
and then he did another one
but he didn't finish the game yet
i also follow the main singer from this smaller band that i like on twitch
i have a bunch
i have a long list of animes i loved
and then i have regular tv shows
and then the ones in a different language
haikyuu is great if you haven't seen that yet
i personally loved darling in the franxx, but it's also one of those that not everyone likes
i thought that how to keep a mummy was great
tanaka-kun is always listless is pretty great
assassination classroom is a popular one that was pretty good
i mean do you have any personal preferences
i will warn you that ditf has some minor nudity
heaven's design team is a new one that is pretty good
i saw clips of it and it was pretty great
that time i reincarnated as a slime is also a great anime
way of the househusband is hilarious
it really issssss
there are tons of clips on crunchrolls youtube
sameeeeeee
i started and stopped this jmedical drama so many times i-
i heard that one's pretty goodddddd
oh that reminds me bungou stray dogs is pretty good
i read an obscene amount of manga once online school started
mangadex or bato.to
some scans teams also made their own sites after mangadex went down for maintenance
mangadex is adless and bato.to has some i think
mangadex died for a few months but it's back and running
lmaooo i was using mangadex to read and track what i was reading so i found out all that stuff
ahahah
i had like manhwas, manhuas, and mangas all in there
pretty much!!! they even have some doujins
not a bunch
but some
i started reading cause i didn't have time to watch lmao
i always end up reading wayy too much so then when people ask, i have a ton of recs
lmaooooo
i do the same thing with stuff on ao3
lmaoooo a lot of what i read is in progress
but honestly it could be a good thing you don't finish
sometimes you get so invested that you forget to do everything else
there were a couple times where i stayed up wayyy too late reading
but it's also so bad when you're 100 chapters behind or something
i was around 200 chapters behind, if not more on tower of god
and i wasted like three days reading it all
and then i stopped reading months later
honestly god of high school was the same
at first i was so hyped
and then it got too long
lookism ended up with the same problem
wait umaaaaaa
have you read gourmet hound?
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh it's so sweet i-
yeah i started a conversation at like 10pm
it was a whim kind of decision
i usually stay up way too late
i usually recommend bato.to or mangadex
webtoon has some too
and i have one chinese app for literally one manhua
but it's really good
i talk a lot
yesssss gourmet hounddddd
the ending was so good
yesssssssssss
the author did please take care of me in my 19th life too
and it's sadddddd
yeahhh
mercenary enrollment is bloody but good
no
a new one
it's a rising one on webtoon, just started getting translated
but there's one done by asura scans or reapers scans that i really love
original
ohhh lookismmmmmmmmmm
hardcore leveling warrior was good but i just kinda lost interest
yeah i really can't stop talking ahahahah
her mannequin has pretty art
no
eleceed is really cuteeeeeeeee
there are cats
i stopped reading after a while for that one as well
it was the love triangle thing that made me stop
yesssss
wait have any of you read men of the harem or remarried empress
strongest florist is pretty great
oh it's hard to get into, definitely
path of the shaman is a manhwa that's not officially licensed yet but it was great
scream queen on bilibili
suitor armor is pretty great
yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
it's amazing
i rarely keep up with the mangas or manhwas now
no, i haven't
lmao i'll probably have to go to sleep sometime in the next hour or so
buuuuuuuuuut
until then
ahahahah i kept telling myself this week i'd go to bed early so i could wake up and get good sleep before class
i went to bed at 1 am and woke at 7-8 am
it wasn't good sleep
s a m  e
w h y
i ask despite having pulled an all-nighter to see what it was like
i knew a few insomniacs
so i got curious
full 24 hours
no sleep
yeahhhhh it's not
i was so out of it it wasn't even funny
i also knew someone who had a caffeine overdose so now i know the symptoms for that
it was our mutual classmate's fault
my friend gave him money to buy some trader joe's cold brew for them and then the guy went and bought two giant bottles of the concentrated type
which my friend drank despite the fact you're supposed to dilute that
yeah
yeah!!! for sure
i handle caffeine poorly
that i don't know lmao
idk how people drink coffee black
i think the only time i've heard of someone having black coffee that seemed feasible was affogato
wait elementary/middle school?
my parents wouldn't let me touch that stuff
they said it would make me short
but i'm 5'3
although they say that's also my disordered eating & messed up sleep schedule
my brother had coffee when he was a child
and he's taller than me
i remember going to some chinese school on saturdays
and every year they'd try to convince us kids to go vegetarian
cause they were buddhist
not as far as i know
they also tried to convert us and make us pray
never had butter chicken
i have no clue, it was a taiwanese organization that my parents registered me for
mood
either way i stopped after sixth grade
but i used to cause so much trouble there
yessssssss
so now i'm almost illiterate in chinese ahahahahah
i use google translate so i can read
i can't understand pinyin sometimes
but i can understand old people talking cause my relatives talk in chinese all the time
although i probably understand more taiwanese over chinese
most of my older relatives speak it
so i picked it up pretty fast cause i was pretty much the only child among the elderly
but sometimes they speak at me in taiwanese and i get all confused cause they think i know more than i do
oml i was so bad when i went to taiwan two or three years ago
i just spoke english the whole time
i can speak some taiwanese, enough to converse
but usually i don't and i'm apparently not supposed to
mainly cause my cousins on my mom's side don't speak it ig?
so it's just weird if i'm speaking taiwanese or using taiwanese phrases when they don't
not that i don't
i used to mix taiwanese and chinese soooooo much
that's a joy luck club moment i swear
my mom always lectures me in chinese but i speak english i-
right?
idk what it is
i am not part of the cult
my status is just a cat
cause cats
ahahahah i did invisible for a bit but couldn't stand it
i just do dnd cause i'm in a bunch of servers so i get notifs all day
and i hear the noises
plus you can sometimes hear the discord notifs in the background of your zoom
there was this one dude in my class who would talk and there would be just the sound of discord notifs
ironically the notifs were messages from people telling him to turn on dnd
i swear no one paid any attention in class
i did absolutely nothing in most of my classes
i didn't even read some of my required reading
my econ/us history was like free period
i was supposed to read dracula, couldn't  get interested
and pretty much only used the book for quotes
my professors & teachers never really called on people
i didn't have to read any shakespeare besides hamlet
the rest of my year was short stories
i honestly made things up for practically every essay i had
i used to have to write art analysis critiques in my art class at high school so i got used to making things up
my english 1b professor really thought i had reading comprehension issues
but i didn't actually read dracula and therefore had no idea what happened in the plot
but since she explained what happened, i wrote an essay that she thought was perfect
it was that bad
so now my brain is just mush
i honestly don't know how i do it, but i have yet to encounter a teacher who finds my writing abilities bad
math however....
oml sameeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
i feel like i'm just going to be losing my mind when school starts
i only just got used to socializing again
earlier in the summer when everyone got their acceptances and were reaching out to make friends i got a handful of dms
and i really froze up and freaked out
i was like wtf am i supposed to do and i was soooo awkward
i got dmed a bunch and i was like 0-0
yeah i had one in revelle 2025 & one on the big ucsd.25 one
idr the thing anymore
i was also in the loopchat & patio
and a few snapchat gcs
i mean i'm also in the discord but i rarely chat there
YES
uma
i am
oml i just got tired of the loopchat and the patio
in one of them i kept getting an at everyone ping
yayyyyyyyyyy cognitive scienceeeeeeeeeeeee
wait what colleges are you all in
i'm in revelle
ohhh nicee
i'm doing ml
i think all i really have left are upper division courses and like the cogsci specific ones
i think i'm sophomore standing? idr
yeah
i have 90 units so i have like 90 left
yeah i did middle college for 11th & 12th
nah
my brain would fry itself
i might take a minor though
i had a few classmates who completed an aa
yeah it's one or the other
i haven't checked course catalog yet, though i should
its like being a full time community college student and a full time high school student
might be because it's only offered then
some classes are like that
well i think you can swap it out unless i'm wrong
but those are all considered ge
it actually wasn't
i had 2 high school classes and 3 college classes
i also took like 3 classes at another community college
my classmates who did aas took classes at the community college we all attended and did more at deanza or something to get their aa
so they're junior standing
lmaooooo nahhh that would be wayy too crazy
i honestly thought it was kinda fun
i got to pick my class times
so it was niceeeeee
yep!
and i remember being so hyped about real cadavers in human bio
i mean i saw a cadaver at 14 so it wasn't that surprising
oh same
i can''t
it was just exciting
same and then i remember the kids at the doctor's office whenever i go
and i shudder
i get so scared and then i watch it anyway
technically, resi 8 scares me
but i watch it even though i jump at everything
i watched it and i was afraid for a really long time
ohhh i saw that game in a stream
i had friends who liked silent hill and the pt
and the pt really scared me
silent hill is really scary ngl
oh it's a playstation horror game series
they were discontinued back in 2017 i think
like the series
lmaooo
totally fair
i wouldn't have known about it either tbh
but man it was creepy
i don't understand how people don't find things scary
my english teacher was like that
he would go to haunted houses where you had to sign a waiver for the experience y'know of getting scared by random people who were paid to scare you
and he was like meh
oml i do too
i scream when i see a bug
i was out walking during a summer program and i saw a bug
i let out a screech of sheer terror
but i was fine when i saw a snake
ahhhh i had this one classmate who tried to chase me around with a worm
ahflfhdasf
honestly i hope my suitemates aren't scared of bugs too
otherwise who are we going to call
man guts of steel
i swear
it was all so simple when we were kids
that's one of my requirements ngl
like i'm afraid of bugs, the other party can''t be as well
ahhhhhhhhhhh
same
i used to be meh spiders
now i'm like panicked screaming
i refuse to touch a bug without gloves on
i need to protect myself
i think i just got creeped out by their movement
i'm so strict about not having to deal with bugs ahahahah
i don't want to have to touch them cause scary
which is exactly why i need to find people who are okay with them
i had a friend who's gonna be at uc berkeley who was great with bugs
wish she came here with me ;w;
then i could live with less fear
i mean i met some people who can't handle cockroaches
and no
i will not handle those
i will scream and leave
i hate that they can fly
i hate it
omg the people who take pictures of bugs and post them also annoy me
omg that kind of person would get blocked
i get so scared when i see bugs
true true
my friends just send me cat pictures
ahahah i send my friend cat posts and then they send me some too
my friend once sent me a video of a cat and said that the cat reminded them of me
it was really random
trueeeeeeeeeeeee
my friend and i have even characterized ourselves as cats for whatever reason
i never got tiktok
my insta sends me tons of cats
and food
but cats
my friend told me i had the personality of a ragdoll cat lmao
i just followed a bunch of tags
i mean like at least 50
and there were a bunch of cat tags ig
i was bored ngl
i mean i groan whenever i get insta notifs
<.<
catttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
it's so cuteeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
sameeee
there are cats in my neighborhood and a few live like within my block
üíõ 
there's one house with a bunch of cats living in the front yard
sam your cat is so cuteeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Y E S
i want
d o g
aaaaaaaaaa
okay like there's a pet pic channel in the 2025 discord
but it's not enoughhhhhh
yeah that's cause of the perms
but idk if we're actually allowed to since it is the game night cateogry
hmmmm idk where to ask lmfao
but i also think no one is free to be indulging us for things like this at 1am
it's okay we can just spam this place
and then ask for one tomorrow ahahah
i wish i had a pet
i only have a pet brother
awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
lmaooo he's helpful
he grinds my mobile games for me
yes
y e s
do you have siblings?
also watch everyone see this tomorrow and be like wtf
ohhh cool!!!!!!!
lmaooooooooo
boba is sooooooo good
what's the flavor you usually get?
lmaooooooooooo
taro's my personal favorite tbh
i grew up drinking that flavor specifically
honestly i hope that by the end of five weeks, this chat is actually more active ahahahah
oh the taro isn't like actual taro usually
they have this taro powder
i've had actual taro and it was flavorless
my mom also once blended taro and put in some boba pearls
and that was traumatic
ahahaha i guess i'll have to be the catalyst
not that i mind
i usually end up starting a bunch of conversations in a different server i'm in
Y E S i hope for that
because i'm also v awkward
yessssssssss
i tried for like 2 days ish? maybe?
idk
finally figured it out ahahahah
i had a lot of practice from the other server since it's a guild server for a game where i have an activity req
i know some of the massive servers have really active chats
but i can't handle those cause you only meet people for what, five minutes?
yep!!!!!
although the kny server i'm in had a hilarious shrine for a once extremely active member of their server
and the funniest part was that the guy's username was inosuke
so for a while i thought they worshipped inosuke
awwwwwwwwwwww that's sadddd
lmaooo he was a character
i thought they worshipped him
turns out it wasn't a cult
honestly most of the way i've been comprehending life since lockdown has been haikyuu
same! i saw someone with the username iwa and immediately thought of haikyuu
haikyuu is pretty fun and wholesome
the fandom is crazyyy big though
i think i started in 8th grade
i think if you're new, the anime might be easier to do over the manga
the manga is finished but there are around 200 chaps
i mean i love the manga sooooooo
but yeah
the anime has four seasons + the side season
so far
sameeeeeeee
that's how i ended up reading manga
and well i couldn't stop myself from reading wayyy too much
but there are a bunch of different fandom related jokes that you end up understanding afterwards ig
so there's that
ahahahah the only person who probably consistently would make those references might be me ahahah
yeah it really takes a lot of time and effort
i think i brought up a couple of older references that had people dying
it's funny how i can't remember what i did yesterday, but i remember most everything from haikyuu
yeah!!! like i know a little too much about a bunch of discord bots
and i also know how to make a webhook
mainly moderation bots like mee6, tatsu, yagpdb, dyno but also some of the reaction role bots as well
i turned on dev mode back in 9th grade and never turned it off
‚òùÔ∏è (2) 
mind you the reason why i turned on dev mode was not good reasons
my friend was really annoyed by some kid and decided to try to get their ip from the discord account
but since they had a steam linked we actually did find the location :p
dev mode is useful for a bunch of stuff
my parents used to use skype to call relatives
i have a bad habit of googling too well
üíõ 
sometimes people ask me how i know things and i just say it was a search
and then they give me the surprised pikachu face
y e a h
the internet will also tell you i'm smart and i understand cs
don't buy it
it's a lie
you have no idea
it took me seven hours to understand what i was supposed to do in step 3 of lab 2
how is that smart
i read it ten times and didn't understand it
i don't even know what that means
that is true josh
but yeah, google makes me sound smart and accomplished cause i'm credited in some paper for cs
but i actually knew nothing about what we were doing
you won't find it
i use my middle name not my legal first name ahahah
:p
no this is my middle name
lmfao
not my first name :p
lmfao
is it really that interesting?
lmao i do too
my friend was the one who picked it for me :p
i didn't have a middle name until now
yeah!!!!
yep
cause i'm tired of my original name :p
also cause it lets me separate people i meet from relatives
fine i'll drop it lmfao

if someone understands what i was doing/supposed to do
please ping me because i still don't know
wdym?
i didn't title it
ohhhhhhhhhhh her
i knew her
i met her a few times
we were in cross country together for a year
wait how lmfao
yeah no, the people from prospect knew me from my original name ahahahah
i-
why
i also haven't updated it cause lazyyyyy
and it's wayyyy too much work
send what
i-
what
i don't know why it pops up at the top
uh nooooooo
i had almost no social life in high school
lmfao
yeah i told myself i'd actually try to be social
‚òùÔ∏è 
guess it worked, i blame my ~~cult~~ i mean new guild
i keep telling myself i'll run out of things to say, and then i don't because my midnight brain always comes up with something weird
i actually liked irl social interactions, i could walk away
i feel trapped in some online convos, esp when they're private cause i've had people private message me and be creepy
soooo
nah i like physically walking away, i think it makes the message clearer
i got messaged by some dude who i didn't know on snap and we were in the same ucsd group chat
and i got weird vibes
and then turns out he was also messaging another friend of mine in the same gc
and he asked to call with her despite us all only meeting for the first time that day
then when i refused to give him my insta, he really stalked me and found me and shamelessly sent me a follow request
so i blocked him on both accounts :p
lmfaooooo
that makes me think of haikyuu
i mean his insta was really weird too
one of my other friends insta stalked him and he had really weird posts about blades and murder?
i don't remember exactly, but it was creepy
s a m e
i will zoom away
i honestly got really lonely and bored during the whole zoom life
ahahah i was in track and cross country two years ago
i assume i can run fast enough to get out of a bad situation
though i've never tried
s a me
oh i can tolerate walking for a long time
there have been a number of occasions where my family has gotten lost so at this point i'm just like sure whatever
ahahahahahahah
honestly though i'm so used to seeing people's pfps that when i see real faces i always end up surprised
i feel like that's the same for me
i guess people get all shocked that i don't look like tendou satori
it's also weird whenever people find my linkedin and the kinda know me and someone messages me with ur pretty
like pls no
ahahahahah
i don't know why i did but i did
ahahah
oml trueeee
i mean some people have really cute pfps
y e s
it is
honestly animal pfps are usually the best
but i also really have a soft spot for the haikyuu ones as well
especially the ones from the manga
ahahahahahah
i honestly found a bunch of zoom backgrounds
so i keep swapping them
i usually try to match with whatever i'm wearing and it's kind of a game now
i mean i have yet to see farmer ushijima or deadchi
i keep playing with them
i also end up stretching a lot ahahha
my inner cat is like stretchy stretchy time
my anxiety makes me hyper aware
especially since once i was unmuted and i told my brother to shut up and my professor was recording
:p
sooooooo
nightmare moment right there
it's fine though
the recording is probably gone now
sameeeeeeeeee
i get so anxious
and then i also worry about what people see me doing
even if i'm just stretching cause sometimes i like to make faces
lmaoooo that's also a good way
i'm gonna miss being able to have a plushie on my table
i don't mind because people kinda stare to start sometimes
lmaoooo i keep it on my desk
it's a husky and i want to say it's as old as i am if not a bit older
lmaooooo
it's gonna stay home
although i swear i can't sleep without holding something like a plushie
so i will be bringing a bigger husky plushie for sure
i'm more concerned about the people who sleep like a log
pffft
the husky that's probably as old as i am makes a barking sound
it's one of those old kids toys
it's a desk ornament, not a plushie really
probably
idk
like i don't hug it or anything
ahahahahahah
honestly i find it so funny how i want to hug people when it's a pandemic
but when it's not then i'm like what is happening when someone randomly hugs me
honestly i don't mind being hugged but that's mainly because i had a few friends who just randomly hugged me
so i'm kind of in a state of okay you want to hug me fine
you want to squish my cheeks, fine
kind of thing
i think the only thing i'm usually like oh no is like being picked up physically
i've had people try to pick me up and it's weird as heckkkkkkkk
i know
i also happen to have a number of tall friends
it's probably cause they're tall
tall friends tend to have a thing for being like, let me help you experience what it's like to be way too far off the ground
i mean i look not too short with my friends
but some of them are like 6ft?
it's honestly really funny but a lot of the people i know just tower over me
honestly i swear it's because i'm short
and that's why i always end up wondering how tall people are
because i need to know if they have that potential thought process of "aerin is short and small, i want to lift"
üò© 
ahahah
i keep track of people's heights mainly cause i need to know where i measure up to
that way i know who i can hide behind and for what situations
oh actually
random human bio fact i learned a while back
you shrink over the course of a day
ahahahah
supposedly i shrank a whole 0.5 inches
buuuut when i measured at home, i was exactly 5'3
soooooo idk what they were talking about
but i swear that's also short people problems
riiiiight
and they're like tall
honestly i consider 5'8 or taller tall
cause that's a whole five inches over my head
ahahahah
idk
ask another dude maybe they'd know
i only know that women is either 5'4 or 5'3
honestly no clue
tbh i don't mind being short, it's just kinda like argH when people bring it up
okay but either way i still think 5'8 is tall
it's five inches over my head
i-
i can sorta
i swear, tall people don't feel that tall until you stand next to them
so ethan, you're a whole half a foot taller than i am
congrats
like i had a classmate in middle school who was 6'4 and i stood next to him
and it was interesting how short i felt
yeah i was in 6th and he was in 7th
i think he went to lynbrook for a bit?
ahahaha
i always forget how tall people are but people at 6ft don't feel too tall to me
are you sure, i thought he went there
he would have been  a year above you
my parents said that if i was a boy they would have called me ethan lmfao
ahahahah
i suddenly remembered something really stupid
i had a classmate who i shared the same set of initials with so the teacher asked who had a middle name and he did so he had to put the initial for his middle name as well
and it was frederick or something
but he kept insisting to me that his middle name was pencil sharpener
this was in second grade, mind you
no
i thought it was hilarious
he also got held back a year
like in kindergarten or something
ahahah
trueeee
that is an important question
oop
honestly it's weird having a middle name now
i feel like most people have had one for most of their lives
i actually picked my brother's middle name apparently
my parents really just gave me a list and said pick
oh i had an official amendment
i mean all the names started with 'c'
did they ever tell you your actual middle name
guess they do?
idk i've only heard one instance
i guess they could if they really wanted to
honestly i already have a hard time thinking up names for pets, much less children
scratch that
i can't even name variables, much less pets or children
ahahahah
if anything i'm probably going to steal names from tolkein or dvergatal
well you might have to name variables and stuff
i also end up having to name essays
and poems
and whatever else my brain comes up with
and then it turns into what in the actual world does any of this mean
so when people ask i smile and laugh
i just follow a format
i put random synonyms together
and then i say here you go
but for poems and stuff i just use whatever really random, abstract thing comes up in my brain first
ahahahah
i mean people tend to find deeper meanings in poems
so i assume they'd do the same with titles
it's one of those tricks
kinda like how people find random deeper meaning in art sometimes
and i just happen to remember the names of random artists and some of their works
i learned some art history as a child
so i know a decent bit about older art
it's honestly just part of the random stuff i happen to know
lmaooo i learned it when i was really young
it was kinda drilled into my brain
just like how to play black jack
and playing hidden object games
lmaooo
i don't know why i remember how to play blackjack so clearly
honestly same
i have memory loss
and sometimes when i google memory loss and i look at the specific kind  i might have
i end up asking myself if google might be accurate when it gives me dementia
ahahah
i've had people tell me i asked them the same question five or six times
and every single time i say "wait really?"
i also remember almost nothing about my childhood or even like more recent stuff
everything goes in my brain and leaves again
my worst anxiety is that i've said something bad and people remember
and then they'll ask me what i meant
and i won't know because no memories
ahahah worst part is that when i do briefly remember things
i always end up realizing that the people i knew growing up were crappy people when i knew them
so then i feel like whatever cause you were horrid too
and it's so ridiculous
that too
but usually i end up remembering why i don't talk to some people and stuff
but i've been meeting less and less crappy people now
so that's gotta be a good thing :3
the fact that there are only four of us online ahahah
i forget them
often and then accidentally offend them
ahahah
is what i ask myself
i just like being wide awake at night
but i also have to wake up tomorrow to go outside and walk ;w;
i honestly need night owls in revelle because i might just not sleep and want to chat all night
ahahahah
i'm excited to hopefully get to stay up late more often at ucsd ahahah
righttttt you're on the other side of campus
ahkfalskhfdaf
my closest night owl friend is at muir i-
oh i have to fix it but no morning classes for me
it's always cold in the morning, esp in winter
sucksssss
isn't erc past muir
revelle was my second choice i think
idk
my mom was like gl getting to classes
but i don't care cause there's the aquarium further down
i just want to go to the aquarium sooooooo
:p
that sounds fun
my uncle was an alum from a long time ago and he told me i could get around just fine with a shuttle
i just wanna run down to the aquarium
that's literally it
everything else is not that interesting ahahah
that is so niceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
yeah i need to find people to stay up with either at my college
or just stay up with together online
i have no clue where cogsci is at all
i hope it's not in the warren area
ohhhhhhhhhh that is going to be funnnnnnnn
i can get my exercise in ig :p
i wish i actually found geisel interesting enough to remember the architect's name smh
some of the housing at ucla is done by john lautner
i only remember around 10 names for architects at most
and most of them had random buildings that i just found pretty
i probably know more renaissancce artists off the top of my head though
my mom taught me art history and used to drill me
we had this book with a card game
and i must have memorize the names before i knew it
i think that's why i got into reading mirror text too and font names
my mom likes art
idk
i just know
i know a number of fonts by name
it keeps me busy when i'm bored
i play a guessing game and try to determine whether someone's using google or microsoft based on font
i also know some of the apple fonts
it's honestly very useless information
but presentations are so boring sometimes
lmaoooooo
ohhhhhhh those are pretty cool
i usually just use some kind of sans serif or serif font
i don't like times new roman cause it's times new roman and prefer palatino
i honestly just keep one original copy of the formatting and fill everything else in
i honestly find essays and english the easiest of all classes
i used to love timed essays
and i think my teacher hated me for loving timed essays
well he didn't actually hate me
i was one of his favorite students
but i would write a ton of pages of stuff
it was usually pretty thick when i was finally done
yeahh
imagine how the person grading my whap test felt
they probably felt like they got slapped with a giant tidal wave of words
i'm just really quick to make thing sup
oml that act essay is so easy
so was the sat essay
except that one time where i got a low score for arguing against the prompt
but we don't talk about that
i thought the essay was the easiest part of the standardized test
i was so bad with math
i really got a 27 on math
even though i did calc ab
honestly that is so fair
ngl i did terrible in precalc/trig as in i understood almost nothing
and i still did just fine in calculus ab
i left with an a
then a semester later i had to drop calc bc because it was like gibberish to me
ahahahah
i was lucky my professor took out the part of the final on integrals since everyone bombed that part
ahahah
i only like derivatives
and my stats class was wayyyyyy better
i just got to use my calculator and not show most of my work
i literally took ab and bc back to back in semesters and still forgot integrals
so now i have to retake bc cause i dropped it
lmao i have most of my ges done so i can't put it off much longer to begin with lmaoooo
oh that is going to be fun in the most painful way possible
that is actually kinda nice
b is not a jump
it's a shove
off a cliff
it's fine though, i think my current existing college gpa can carry me even if i mess up two math classes
whenever i see p/np i think of that millenium problem
it's one of those very difficult to solve math problems that has like a huge reward if you can get the correct solution
i want to say that one of them did get solved but i also might have remembered wrong
i know they mentioned p/np but not the actual problem itself
i was watching gifted and the millenium problems came up
along with the trachtenberg method i think
i remember uselessly large words and then when i need to use them my brain goes b l a n k
trachtenberg is a last name
i am usually that one student who is technically done but keeps writing anyway
i know i have a large vocabulary
i just never use it
and i really like learning those random words from tumblr that are so rarely used
and then i don't use them
the only time those tumblr words ever come into use is when yet another person titles a fanfic using one of those
i learned words like gracile
which i never use
and then i randomly apply chemistry terminology to real life
despite sleeping through my chemistry honors class during my second semester
i still don't know how i got an a in that class
and my chem 1a was carried by huge extra credit
i overuse state function
not in the literal sense
but i just use it to mean like the process isn't important, just the destination
i think i've also equated people to the different elemental groups before
and people always look at me funny for it
not that i find it important how they feel lmfao
i'll just be like "noble gas personality type" out of the blue
or i'll say someone's like a halogen
i think the weirdest thing i've ever done was try to convert all my writing into old english runes
old english and old english runes are different
the runes looked a lot like dwarvish from lotr
and i thought they were pretty
yeah
i mean before that i wanted to write mirror script but being left handed, i technically could have done that to start
yeah it really does
there's also elvish which is pretty
i also at one point wanted to be ambidextrous
so i can kinda write with my right hand
i mean i usually don't but i can do it alright
i can read mirrored text just fine
i can technically draw with my right hand using a mouse
but not with a pencil
not that well
ahahah when i write fast i end up with print-cursive
the only thing i can consistently draw are cats
and sometimes bears
i learned cursive and now i mix my print and cursive
it looks confusing as heck though reading my notes
usually when i write words that end in ing, the i disappears
it just leaves
i also don't dot my i's anymore sooooooooo
my i's and e's look similar
ahahahah i write things down by hand
i tend to forget otherwise
cause if i type i sometimes i forget to check where i left whatever i wrote down
honestly i just realized
i'm kinda like a function
i just take in input, create an output
and then i forget everything again
it actually explains why i have no clue what i've turned in for the most part
especially my essays, thank goodness no one asks me to explain those
ahahah i made my brother so frustrated
he was trying to help me check my code
and then he was like wth
oh i don't even really remember the prompt after i write it
ahahah
i literally just try to think of the easiest way to solve the problem so i can write almost zero code
i mean i just make something up
if i get a hint of what i should say, i can usually make something up
guess the theatre classes i took panned out years ago
ahhhhhh same
i usually say something and then i end up overexplaining myself
they give me so much anxiety
but i also did them ig
technically i guess i can act, i'm good with expressions
ahahah
when we had to do closing circle i really wrote out what i was going to say
i still panicked anyway ahahah
i used to do musicals so theoretically i should be okay with like idk stages?
but i'm not
it took a long time
and everyone just kinda thanked other people
and i just read whatever i wrote while panicking
oh i have stage fright too
the deer in the headlights
oh it was mandatory for everyone
i swear things were easier when we were kids
like being on stage and stuff
i don't know how i did it then
it really wassss
honestly i was thinking back to the musicals i did
and i just realized how weirdly sexist my fair lady was
like there's this whole song when the english professor rants about women
trueeeee
honestly i got into musicals because of my parents
awwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
i think the first musical i saw was les mis or phantom
i didn't understand the lovely ladies thing until like years later
no not really
my dad just had them and i was introduced to them early
although i watched ghibli films long before that
i think the last muscial i saw was carrie
ohhh hamilton is fun
i don't remember if i did
but i was looking forward to the in the heights film
did you ever have a gymnastics phase?
now that i think of it, maybe my first musical was sound of music
ahahah sameeeeeeeeeee
and then i stopped
but i really wanted to do a handstand, so i taught myself
i swear everyone did back in those days
ahahah
i did ballet i think idk
i don''t remember
i can still do it, but it's best when you're in a pool
soo much easier
ohhh
that actually makes sense
you could also do it against a wall
i honestly went through trial and error to do it
but i also did basketball as a sport
soooooooooo
i can't say if sports were really my thing
i just did them
same
i was only good at guarding
i just didn't like doing offensive stuff
honestly if i actually focused on cross country, my stamina would probably be better smh
i think by the end of the season was when my stamina was just beginning to get good
and then the season ended ahahahah
i don't even know how i convinced myself to run 2 miles
and the worst part was i had a friend who was shouting at me to run faster ahahah
honestly 1 mile is so nice
pfft i would actually slow down
just to spite him ahahah
oml the 400 m as a track event is so hardddddddddd
i still remember doing training
i'd have to do those weird things where you sprint 50 m and walk 50 m or something and go up by increments of 50 or something
i ran a 3200 once
it was horrid
i did pretty good in 400
and then i quit
honestly lining up gives me anxiety
i just get all freaked out being in line and stuff
oh yeah, track definitely is like RUN RUN RUN
i used to just watch people get smoked
like one of the soccer players was in track and he would outsprint practically everyone in the 100m
i find it hilarious
also perhaps we should sleep
ahahah
like it's almost 4 am
yes
time flies
because it's fun
but i also need to zip it and sleep before i wake up tomorrow and bask in my regret like i did this morning
i say that like it isn't already the next day
it's fine
because i'll probably start another long convo tomorrow :3
ahahahahahah
y e s and we can hang out more
i also have stuff to do tomorrow like looking at my classes i need for graduating in a few years lmao
good nightttttttttttttt :3
angelWBlobsleep (2) 
i-
hi sammmmmm
hi alexxxxxxxxx
last night we had a pet picture thing for a bit lmao
yeah & someone suggested an actual channel for pet pictures :3
‚ù§Ô∏è (3) 
but it was like 1-2 am ahahahah
yayyyyy
@jennosaur‚ô° we have one nowwwww
how‚Äôs everyone doing so far today? :3
i was going to just not wake up early but my mom was like we *have* to go outside and walk sooo i got dragged outside
that‚Äôs hilarious
you know what i find really weird about spotify, and yes it‚Äôs really random
i set my language as english but it will still give me ads in spanish sometimes even though i don‚Äôt really understand spanish at all
sure i took three years of spanish, but i also didn‚Äôt really understand it lmao
i don‚Äôt do anything in spanish at all lmao
the last time i googled spanish was for google translate
my spanish 3 teacher really thought i knew how to write essays but none of us learned how to in spanish 2
lmaooo idk how the ad algorithms work either
youtube likes to give me men‚Äôs deodorant ads lmfao
i swear every foreign language teacher assumes you can write essays at a certain point
okayyy lmao
don‚Äôt get carsick ;w;
awwwww good luck alexxxxx
also that‚Äôs good jenny!!!! :3
wait jenny what flavor??? üëÄ
lmaoooo that‚Äôs great!!!
aaaaaaaaa that sounds p long for a walk
especially if you haven‚Äôt been walking much
ngl i don‚Äôt go outside most days of the week myself ahaha
fr fr!!! i swear i get more exercise when school is in-person
otherwise i‚Äôm like, i‚Äôll just stay indoors
lmaooo
i feel like it‚Äôs such a hassle going outside
my parents are like wear a mask, wipe your hands every time you get back to the car, wash them when you get home, wipe everything you buy
i felt that sooooo hard
i swear my doctor is secretly thinking that this is exactly why i have a vitamin d deficiency
i was supposed to start taking them way back in 6th grade after i went to my doctor about wrist pain
i had to get examined pretty thoroughly cause she was convinced i either had arthritis or carpal tunnel
but then they did bloodwork ig and i had a vitamin d deficiency
ofc i constantly forget to take the pills lmfao
well she prescribed painkillers that didn‚Äôt work soooooo i guess that was why she thought that?
m e
i have like two i have to take daily
and one of them is like an inch long
i have no idea honestly
i guess it was cause it wasn‚Äôt something painkillers could help with??? idk but it got better because of the vitamin d supplements lmao
i‚Äôm gonna have to take two giant bottles of supplements with me and my melatonin ahaha
my parents bought it for me after a psychiatrist said to i think, or something
it‚Äôs nice when i messed up my sleep schedule and need to brute force fix it
which is exactly what i need to do today
i went out, came home and napped soooo i just woke up a few minutes agoo
yeah don‚Äôt overtake
i knew someone who took a bunch of high dosage melatonin and at some point it just stopped working
so def be careful about taking too much cause the stronger sleep meds are illegal here i think or at the very least, extremely difficult to obtain
at least from what i‚Äôve heard
oh it‚Äôs weird as heck when it kicks in
it kinda feels like when you‚Äôre sick and you took medicine and you‚Äôre slowly getting increasingly tired
and then you‚Äôre guaranteed around 5 hours i think
but it‚Äôs not like it instantly kicks in
ahhhhh being sick sucksssss
another reason why i don‚Äôt go outside
i really skipped getting sick all of my senior year and i was soooo happy
especially when i got to skip flu season i was overjoyed :3
good luckkkkkkkkk
yayyyyyyy jennyyyyy
i can keep you company while i do my aps ahahah
i'm telling myself i have to get it done
i spent all of high school procrastinating
and i have some pretty interesting stories from that
so needless to say, i'm trying to get it together and not do that through all of college ahahah
i procrastinated on a whap shower curtain and ended up ruining a decent jacket over it
so i'm trying not to have a repeat of that in college
i just realized i also semi-slept through the star wars unit of my whap class and some of my english classes before
did no one else take whap and have to do a giant shower curtain?
as for star wars, my teacher had us watch it to learn how to write the long essays questions and the saqs
apparently it had all the proper components for a response that would get you a good score
but i really just kinda slept through part of the star wars thing
although my teacher was a *huge* star wars fan, as in he had boba fett tattooed on his arm
so maybe he just chose star wars cause he liked it a bunch ahahah
üòÜ 
honestly though i can understand star wars being unique
but i swear it wasn't just me who had to do the giant shower curtain thing
i had to go out and buy a giant shower curtain in like april or may to use it for the project
and then i kinda procrastinated until like 11 pm and stayed up until 5 am doing the project and at some point i absentmindedly messed up and one of my sleeves turned pitch black and my arm got stained too
all because i rested my arm on an uncapped black sharpie
ofc i finished the giant shower curtain and managed to turn it in just fine and got a decent grade on it
but i ruined a decent jacket over it
yeah and the jacket was my basketball one :p
thank goodness my season was over or i'd have to explain the giant black stain of sharpie that wouldn't come out
y e s
i used to hear my english teachers in high school tell people not to procrastinate on the essays
and then there was me who also put it off and took like 4-5 hours to write one essay and turn it in
i don't know if they actually knew i was doing the essay last minute or not though
jennyyyyyyyyyy, how's the event?
riiiiiight?
that's niceeeee :3
also lowkey, i think my teachers know cause i turn things in at such odd hours
it'll be four am and my essay will just be submitted
i have a trick for that
i just preset my send
i'll have emails sending at 8 am when i'm fast asleep ahahah
ahahahah
i usually have things in at weird times since i actually feel motivated for whatever reason at weird hours
i think that by the end of high school, my teachers just kinda stopped asking questions about why in the world i was up at like 2 am
that's why i liked timed essays so muchhhhhhhhhh
i seriously can't think of anything to write when i'm trying to write an essay early usually
i have an unimaginable amount of run on sentences
it's not even a joke
i try really hard not to, but it happens so muchhhhh
oml i try not to let my sentences get too long
but i got into a bad habit of writing exceedingly long sentences with no real idea of when i should stop the sentence
i used to get in so much trouble for having like 10 different run ons
i don't get how anyone writes essays without run ons
that is so true
but also when i usually write, it's not for schoolwork so i created a bunch of really really really bad habits
yessssssss
what about youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
lmao do you have any other hobbies? :3
oml i could neverrrrrrrrrrr
ohhhhhhh that's so cool
there's this stage apparently near 6th that does karaoke?
or maybe i just don't remember which college correctly ahahah
i think i've only ever written 150 ish pages
but i have hit 200 pages compiling recipes i found interesting
i think cookbooks are one of the faster ways to have an insane amount of pages
honestly, i don't know how to cook, i just follow the instructions
it works out just fine
wait jennyyyyyyyyyyy
what shows have you been watchinggg
ahahah cdramas
i admire your patience
my parents used to have me watch those taiwanese tv shows and ahklajdfks
i would just be like "HURRY UP AND GET TOGETHER, IT'S SO OBVIOUS YOU TWO WILL DATE"
fr fr
n o
i felt that
honestly i'm kinda surprised no one has joined us yetttttttttt
honestly i have no idea
i mean there are so manyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
it's like high school clubs x 100 i swear
let's be real, i didn't join any clubs in high school
i didn't join any clubs at the community college i was at either
i don't think clubs were as important as people thought they were
my honors bio teacher had an anime club that i occasionally crashed
i remember she liked one piece
oh i have a horror story about a club leader
it's not like horror horror
but man it sucked
so this kid was a freshman in my chem honors class cause he apparently took a bio class at harker summer before school started and he made a science club which he claimed would be amazing
ofc i ended up joining cause i was interested and he said he wanted to be a cardiothoracic surgeon and i thought perhaps there would be dissections and fun things
instead, i found out we were studying
yes, *studying*
and it wasn't like the normal stuff we learn in high school, we were studying for the national science bowl for whatever reason
and the most "fun" thing he did was a project where people made ovens out of old pizza boxes and tinfoil which is something you can do as a child
the national science bowl stuff is the horror
it lives in my nightmares
everything there was so abstract and weird
nope
i ditched shortly afterwards despite him trying to get me stay for a bit
ig it had something to do with me being decent at chem + bio but like no way was i going to study some weird abstract stuff when our team was weaksauce
they spent a few months and then went to competition and then lost within the first round
apparently the club is still around
that i don't know
i highly doubt they went too far in the competition though
there were a lot of other school within our bracket that could easily beat them out
the only two extracurriculars at my school that were clubs and actually good at what they did would be mock trial and robotics
in my sophomore year the school's mock trial went to state, i think
and robotics went to worlds in texas
i think the only other club i can remember being relatively remarkable was the math & physics tutoring club
but yeah, most of the clubs at my school were random though i think we had an esports club
and we had a nintendo club for one year
oml thoseeee
weren't they popular in elementary school?
that was sooooo long ago i swear
oml rainbow loom?
that's been so longggggggggg
the only really interesting that happened during my elementary school days was i had a bunch of overnight trips starting in 3rd grade
so i can safely say i've been to a farm and smelled what farm smells like
i just remember my overnight trips cause i had two each year including my 6th grade
i actually kinda know where that is
i used to have beach trips for three years straight
we'd camp somewhere and then go to the beach during the day
it was during the fall, around october-november i think when we'd go
so it was cold as heckkkkk
omg i hate camping for that same reason
i remember my 4th grade trip was gold country so we went to somewhere in norcal
no wait
that was my 5th grade 2nd overnight
my fourth grade's non-beach trip was the one where we went to mendocino
and the car ride suckedddddddddddd
i think everyone got slightly carsick
and we lived in cabins in the woods and there were bugs
and i saw a banana slug and screamed
ahahah
and kiss them
and i'd just stare at them grossed out
and there were also creeks and people would really play in them even though there were water skeeters on the water
my hatred for banana slugs is exactly why i couldn't attend ucsc ahahah
although it wasn't as bad as the invitation i got last year from  a school whose mascot was a spider
and they really said they thought they could see me as a spider i-
yesssssssssssssssssssssssss
yesssssssss
i just realized my two high school friends who are at ucs are bears
like both of them
ucla is also a bear
and then ucsb is a black big cat who wears a funny hat i think
and then there's another uc with a dude who has a big cheesy grin
at least i think there is idk
uci is anteater
lmaooooo
i don't know how people keep friendships when they're at different schools ngl
but i did tell my friend at ucla we should meet up sometime
and my friend who's going to u of toronto promised to drop by and visit me in sd :3
ahahahah my friend who's going to u of t moved away to seattle and there's a cat cafe there
and ig they haven't visited it yet cause i didn't get pictures yet ahahah
honestly toronto is super farrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
same
honestly  i don't know my geography too well
so i just found that out now ahahahh
but it's all good
cause i promised i'd visit them sometime cause i wanna try poutine
that's super coollllllllllll
i have a bunch
and i usually stop talking to them after a while which is sad
buuuut i don't think that's gonna happen with my guild because i really don't stop talking
time zones really mess things up though
cause some of my friends are in se asia or something
fr f r
my mom always tells me my time is upside down in chinese
and like honestly, yeah
i do tend to have my times flipped
i have a friend in taiwan but i also don't talk to her much ahahah
oml yesssssssssssss
i wanna go to japan
everything looks so pretty there
especially the food
honestly now i have an actual reason to be up at odd hours since some of my friends from my guild like haikyuu and they're in a diff timezone
fr fr
which is exactly why i should learn some japanese
y e s
i picked up more japanese from the japanese medical tv show i watch than i do from animes, oddly enough
whenever i watch animes i usually just end up remembering what the subs say, not the actual japanese lmfao
definitely
especially since haikyuu has some dialects
like the miya twins speak in i think the kansai dialect
so they kinda speak a bit different
i picked up a bit of korean from binging an idol competition or something
although i knew how to say good morning cause i had a teacher in elementary school who liked to have people do good mornings in different languages so everyone learned something new ig
i watched the unit, not produce 101 lmao
i don't know how i got into it, but i ended up hooked
yesssssssssssss
lmaooooooo
i feel like sometimes you don't mean to enjoy something as much as you do
but then when you find out it's just hard to stop
i remember i had this phase where i thought premed and neurosurgery was so cool
and then i read when breath becomes air
and it was so sad but i liked it so much? so i bought a copy
wait jennyyyyyyy
have you ever read or seen where'd you go bernadette?
honestly i really enjoyed it
i'm probably going to rewatch it when i'm at ucsd lmao
same with stick it
wait jenny what have you read?
like what's classic fiction for you?
ahhhhhhh sameeee
i'm already blocking out when his birthday stream is tomorrow ahahah
my priorities are so whacked out
i'm honestly excited because i was at his first twitch which happened last month
and it was really fun honestly
although i do hope he finishes resi 8
yeah they really do
some of them are soooo long
it was like 4-5 hours of streaming  i think
oml college app season ahahahahahahahah
mine was such a disaster
i honestly just read manga instead of writing my supps
omllllllllll that's wild
i don't even know how i survived last year
ahahah my mom is the one who handles the questions
but i also wasn't close with any of my underclassmen so no one asks me about stuff like that
the only app essays i'll be looking at are my other childhood friend's essays, maybe and that's cause he's the son of my mom's bestie from high school
at least for this season
i read so many  fanfics that i know what bad storytelling sounds like
i spent my last year of high school reading manga and fanfics
i think it depends on the fandom really, the quality is all over the place
content is the only thing i can actually help with
yessssssssssss
i will say that tags really cull the herd, that and how they summarize
usually you can tell how experienced an author is from the way they summarize, tag and other stuff
the ones who write on tumblr as well as ao3 tend to have better content from what i've noticed
i've also noticed a bunch of wattpad writers tend to like those weird looking fonts
honestly i have seen some decent all lowercase fics
i don't usually go on tumblr either ahahah
i mean they don't
somehow they have these html copy paste ones
yessssssssssssssss
oml sameeeeeeee
i gotta wrap that up
i mean
it's not graded lmaooooooo
i'm just going to answer with whatever comes out of my brain
ngl i'm approaching it the same way i approach essays
i just write without too much thought and usually things make lots of sense
now i'm kinda curious, are you the type of person who plans out an essay or one who just writes one without any planning or outlining?
actually if anyone else wants to answer this question, please do
yeah!!! is anyone else here??? ;w;
s a m e
my brain does it fine as i'm working through the essay and it sounds so much more cohesive than it would if i was trying to hit all the points i planned out
did you mean the aps discussion yesterday? if so i didn't download any files, i just wrote down what was relevant to the questions and that was it lmao
yeah sometimes you end up needing some weird thing to open files
i also noticed sometimes the files end up downloaded or uploaded as weird files
the only stuff i have written down is that chart he drew of the 33 coin problem
oml i had to set up snagit on this laptop since it's new
the one i was going to buy still hasn't been released yet so this is my interim laptop ahahah
i mean i also have the stuff he said about 1b + 1c
yeah the windows computers have this built in screenshotter known as snipping tool
but i find it kinda tiring to use since i don't think it has a hotkey
so i had my dad download snagit since it lets me set a hotkey
so were you able to open the file or do you want me to share a pic of the notes i took lmao
okayyyyyyyyyyyy that's goodddd :3
functions like math functions
or functions like programming functions
i still kinda remember math functions
do we actually?
e w
math
okay i just looked at the 1a chart
and i think my brain got it
wait jennyyyyyyyyyyyyy
which artists do you listen to
cause i remember when you messaged me you said something about my music taste
nooooo it's all gooddddddddddd
dw about it too much
ohhhhhhhh
greatest showman was so gooodddddddddddddddddddd
i know
it's just so pretty i-
i spent some of the time on aps but rn i've been renaming my playlists on spotify
and some of them have such dumb names now
lewis capaldi
i swear he sings angst i-
also i felt that so hard
wait jenny have you heard some of the unreleased ed sheeran stuff?
he was on yesterday and he kept saying he was gonna release these two songs from the film but he never did
i-
i was waiting for penguins and one life to become singles or something
and he never did
i just really liked those two songs in particular lmao
they're only on yt tho
which suckssssssssss
but i only really keep up with corpse at this point lmfao
man new laptops are such a pain
so glad my dad loaded all the important stuff of mine onto a hardrive
that is so fairrrrrrrrrrr
lmao
but yeah i def get corpse being intense
i think his least intense song is probably agoraphobic
although he does have new stuff coming sometime
soft songs are so niceeeee
i think i found most of my soft songs from one of those remix youtube channels
lmao ballads
i have this really random taste
at first it'll be k/da or something and then musicals and then sea shanties
okay but if you're into like bass singers
i have a rec, he does covers on youtube
and his bass is quite nice
not like corpse deep
colm mcguinness?
i got a little too into sea shanties cause i was listening to reinaery
and then he showed up
i mean i learned a few on guitar years ago and wanted the nostalgia and then i got hooked to the bass
i swear that song reminds me of my 6th grade days
and then country roads & green day's boulevard of broken dreams is elementary school
omg i was in choir in elementary school tooooooooooooooooooooo
ahahah
nah it was school choir lmfao
i used to have to wake up so early for that
i remember we sang once upon a december from anastasia once
and back when 1D was getting huge, we sang a song from them
and we sang the christmas in whoville thing though i think we messed that one up a bunch during practice
i knowwww
it's so weird thinking about how i willingly woke up early
ahahahah
i don't remember why i did it
but we did sing a disney song
omg i knew about 1D only cause we had to sing one of their songs and the daughter of the mom in charge of choir loved the band ig
which is how it ended up on our song lineup
we sang it during springtime or something
i think it was "that's what makes you beautiful"
lmfao
ahahahahahahahahah
i swear things were so simple back then
no pandemic and less things to do
honestly y e s
life was so fun pre-hs
then it was like 
S T R E S S
high school's proper synonyms are pain and stress ahahah
y e s
oml it's like every day they wake up and choose to be blind
i-
yeah technicallyyyy but also technicalities are kinda eh
honestly
i just considering morning whenever i wake up
:p
also like yeah, idk what it is with school and sketchy things lmfao
n o
it's always whenever you wakeup
cause it's morning somewhere else in the world aaaaaaaa
jenny did you got to a public school or a private school?
i swear most people i know always shit on private schools lmfao
oh wow that's pretty cool!!!
i think it really depends on the school tbh
that's also a good point
like i remember people saying that harker was an academically strong private school
ohhhhhhhhhhhh
that is indeed a very awkward thing
i had a friend who went a catholic school and was like "i learned almost no science"
yeah evolution is controversial, don't some states refuse to teach it?
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh i felt that
i've had teachers like that and they are so difficult
i think i pissed off my 9th grade advisory teacher that way lmfao
i don't feel sorry at all though
i think he was a bit backwards to begin with
he was just supposed to help us get oriented during the first month of school
and i may or may not have said some interesting things that made him speechless
well
i think it'll make more sense if i just say what happened
so he was talking about manners and stuff because i guess that's something he found really important and he was telling us about dating etiquette and i was like okay whatever
but my friend (the one who attended a catholic school & is going to u of t) and i were kinda just semi paying attention until he said something like "guys if a girl laughs at your jokes, it means they like you"
it was his fault for what happened afterwards cause he added a "right ladies?"
and i just lost it, i started laughing and he looked at me funny and asked if i had anything to say, and i said yeah sure i did 
and i told him "well, they could also feel bad for you"
yeah and he stared at me flabbergasted as my friend and i burst into another round of hysterical laughter
and we never saw him again since advisory ended that day
ahahahahah he didn't disappear
we just never had to see him again cause advisory was over
i think since that day he never liked me as a student again though i'd never know cause he wasn't my english teacher
lmfao it's one of the few times when i regret nothing
he was backwards in that sense and honestly it was kinda weird
i don't think people have to laugh with you, sometimes they can laugh at you
so hearing that was just weirdly very funny
sometimes i do it without thinking
i mean in that situation i didn't have a choice cause everyone was staring lmfao
but still i think there are def times it's better to say nothing
it takes so long to think of good ones
perhaps lmfao
at the very least, it made for an interesting final advisory
i feel like since it takes so long to come up with retorts, i usually just end up saying exactly what i'm thinking
and then things like that happen
i felt that
there are times i strongly regret not saying something and being like "ur wrong"
that's such a mood though
wanting to say something and then panicking and changing it midway through
i love making portmanteaus
not me misspelling big words like portmanteaus
talking is so hard sometimes i swearrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
t r u e
especially when you're trying to talk to someone for the first time????
like i get all anxious and panicky
omg speaking typos
ahah i'm probably gonna steal that ahahah
sometimes that happens
omg i remember making portmanteaus of names too sometimes
okayyyyyy
yeah we had a fun group yesterday ;w;
that sounds so far away
lmaooo same, i'm probably not going to recognize people since i usually remember their profile pictures :p
üòÜ (2) 
quarter system does weird things like that
quarter system is going to be kinda weird for me

i don't do it often :3
i probably got used to it cause i used to overdo it as a kid once i realized i could
sometimes my voice gets all growly for no reason lmao
and then i just make it a thing for the rest of the day
i can't tell if i squish them or not lmao
i can shift where it's getting growly now so i probably won't run into issues
i knowwww
i remember watching the gollum segment with andy serkis

zoe your hoodie is cuteeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
i block all memories of the single high school homecoming i attended

and it had a funny black tea taste
it was that basic looking brown one like the emoji
okay but why not the ones with cat ears
also me: has done the same halloween costume countless times
i'm unoriginal as heckkkkkkkk
okay but would trick or treating be something college students do
that looks fun
i skipped all the social events for my 11th and 12th grade for good reason lmao
i doubt it, i had a pseudo stalker at the school events
ohhh that's nice
nah there were other people who reported the dude and nothing happened
yeah lmao
my school did proms, but they were like at golf courses or something
it was weird
also anyone else who's online and looking at this chat! don't be a stranger!!!!!
oh he's going to sjsu
and he's probably going to stalk all the poor girls at bus stops
:p
ohhh cuteee
WAIT
I JUST SAW THE UP PIN
ahdfjkaslfsdf
i collected pins a long time ago
omg baymaxxxxxxxxx
i heard there was lemur poop coffee
i think i've heard of it
but i also know a lot of really random and weird things
OMG
those!!!!
i had a floriography phase so i definitely have uselessly weird knowledge
lmao giraffes, sorry there was gartic phone earlier today with giraffes on a stream lmao
OH THAT SOUNDS FUN
that is super cool!!!!!!!!
lmaooo i know some human anatomy facts, symbolism and like other useless things
i feel like animal facts are more useful
that is cooooooooool
so you're telling me they're about as tall as the average height of exes (probably)
3/4 exes were at least 6ft or taller
yep
i don't even find em, they find me
although i'm way better at advice for bad ppl to not date lmfao
it's okay jenny and zoe, if you both need hugs i'll give them all to you
yes sam
i support
YES
and if you need advice on bad vibes people, i got u
i have met so many bad vibes ppl so i kinda developed a bit of a radar
omg this
and then if you have trust issues & stuff it gets even harder
lmaooo dw zoe, you match my energy
talk as much as you want with me
i had some pretty terrible friends for a really really really long time lmao
oh i did lmao
lmao my group projects went good cause i found decent people who did their parts lmao
lmaooo my teachers probably question how i get good grades
i slept through a lot of some of my classes and still had as :3
HI
it's not morning
not until we wake again
at 12 am, my chaotic energy switch just kinda flips
and then i have a hard time stepping away from conversations and actually sleeping
LOVE THIS
n oo
pffft you wouldn't know that
i remember it was like 1-2 am a few days ago and josh joined us
so :3
i hope i'm not scaring anyone who's still awake lmfao
i don't even drink coffee because caffeinated tea does a number on me
it's night somewhere else in the world
ahahahahh
you should have said you had issues with the school lmao assigning so much hw
SAME
üíõ 
i just brainlessly talk and then it disappears
i am dory
lmao i also have long term memory loss
yes
i slept through my english and it did *nothing*
i just get those random moments when i'm super tired
like you know how cats fall asleep in the afternoon
yeah i got to be really careful about my afternoons
wait whyyyyyyyyyyy?
this is probably part of the reason why the whole "aerin is a cat" thing started in the first place i-
awwwwwwwwwwww
do hugs make you less angry ?
i swear quarantine did a number on me and my brain flipped upside down
i used to be like hisss hugs
now i'm like i will give everyone hugs if they want em as long as they're not creepy
and i also have become exceedingly overaffectionate and talkative
ahahh
i can never get out of the getting hugged phase
i like to ask before b/c i know some people are like really uncomfy
i had a guy friend and people kept saying he liked me
i thought he didn't but it turns out he did cause i realized like three years later he kept trying to ask me out
Y E S
i am also really the type to randomly say "i love you platonically" to people
just to remind them they're loved
WE REALLY DO
i love you too (platonically)
i tack on platonically unless i mean it otherwise
because i don't want misconceptions
some people think i send hearts because i like them, like no i send them to everyone ‚ù§Ô∏è
oh yeah and i friendzoned him so hard at that time lmfao
wdym lmao
i didn't even know i was friendzoning but eh
ohhh well i've had some weird cases where people did weird things
for example, i was volunteering at my school art show and being nice cause well i was volunteering and this senior started hitting on freshman me
once i get comfy with people i do it often
SAME
üíú
i only find the ones with hearts
the dude even offered to take me home it was like wayyy too far
üò≥ (2) 
ooof but i am equally easily confused too
i just don't get it
ME
people really have to tell me otherwise i'm just like cool ig
lmaooooo
y e s
honestly i just can't read people well
sameeeeeeee
SAME
and those weird emoji paragraphs?
i really went and googled like "what does this emoji mean"
i didn't even know what cap meant
but lie is also 3 letters?
i always end up being like "what do you mean"
and then people are like "awww you don't know" as if it's cute i didn't get it
i just ask because i really live under a rock sometimes
i swear people are just like ur so cute
i had a former classmate who would take a bunch of photos of me b/c they thought i was cute/pretty
and like i-
it was weird knowing that they had a whole album with pictures of me and they were candids
idk it was middle school
i kinda just got used to people kinda doing things like that without asking lmao
lmaooooooo
i mean i can't controll them lmfao
i knowww
honestly i hate that
the whole if you're at work you can't tell someone they're being a bad human
lmfao
nah my solution is usually find someone intimidating and stay around them
lmaooooo
wha t
the last time a saw a machete was in back for blood
no, i pick based on height
although i had a short friend (the one going to u of t) who is intimidating because computer skills
exactly
but i do get curious about people's height
i coulddd
lmaoooo zoeeee
yeah sam is really talllllllllllllll
i'm a whole five inches shorter
‚úåÔ∏è ü•≤ 
honestly i can really scare people
but for the wrong reasons
i can keep my face expressionless for a really long period of time
i think i creeped out a teacher with that
i usually fall under that category
but there have been times i actually scared people
ahahahahah
i am a huge crybaby too
when i'm getting confused or flustered or trying to make a point
i just end up crying
idk there's my cute angry
and then there's my seething, actually terrifying angry
usually i fall in the cute angry where people don't take me seriously
oh i just have no expression when i talk to authority figures
my facial muscles just kinda die
hate this
when my facial muscles are dead people are always like "i can't read you" but i also don't care enough to actually idk express myself
rightttttttttttt
and then i'm like okay i'll just be petty
but i also don't have enough energy or ability to be petty enough
i felt that
i didn't glare but i had no expressions because idk that's how i hung out with toxic people
i wanted to be petty with my mom's high school classmate but don't have the energy to
well she approached me
told me i "looked lonely" and told me dw her daughter will keep me company next time
and i almost lost my self control
i just kinda wanted to cuss her out but like idk
well it was all boys
see my mom's hs best friend has 2 sons
that other woman had a son there
and i have my brother
so i was the only girl
but that lady's daughter is a literal child & i'm an adult
plus i've hung out with the other 2 boys plenty of times???
i know right
i was gonna swear but her kid is 12
pushy?
just her son
either way i was like i have my bloody boundaries!!! i learned that from therapy!!!
so like reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
idk what it is with some asian moms and boundaries
i know which is why i was going to be petty and not respect her since she didn't respect me as an 18 year old
idk i don't really want to hang out with her children lmfao
idk
if i do, i'll have to think of a good roast
i'll find out on thursday or friday this week if we have to see them this weekend
ahahah me too me too
okay we should really sleep
yes goodnight zoe
actually really, goodnight everyone
because we have class at 8 tomorrow ahahahahahah
ily 2, but no romo
also i love the no romo thing it's cut e
okay okay we should actually sleep
i've been saying this since yesterday but the playlist has so many good songssssssssssssssssss
Y E S
i need more people to add to it!!!!!
y e s
p l e a s e
more catssssssssssss y e ssssss
i think there's a bongocat version of nezuko
it's that or it's a reee for nezuko
i just love cats ahahahah
actually speedcat scans has practically all the bug cat emotes
BugcatAwe 
i really hope there are cats who hang around on campus lmao
ahahahahaha
i-
i get it's cat as an acronym but
;w;
omg house of memories is soooooo good
AH I LOVE THAT ONE ZOEEEEEE
honestly once i got hyperaware of cats, i realized there are actually a lot of cats near my house
AH ZOEEEE THAT"S SO CUTE TOO
whenever i see cats or dogs i just feel really happy
i think it's kinda like the whole thing with bulldogs and it being hard to breathe
i remember people also said that munchkin cats with super stubby legs are concerning too
most purebred cats have issues cause well,,, inbreeding
honestly i like mixed breeds more for that very reason
plus they're actually v v v cute
omg that is really not cute
i'm going to have to meet with two different ones cause of my weird situation
ohhhhhhhhh
i mean my cogsci just has a bunch of prereqs and a math class or maybe a million i have to take
then i'm onto upper division stuff
machine learning & neural comp
omgggg we can suffer togetherrrrr
i mean i did calc ab ;w;
i skipped precalc trig at my school b/c i could
our school had this weird setup where if we took a specific math class we could skip that part so i did
and i took precalc trig concurrent and remembered nothing
but calc a went just fine
oh we were on the integrated math system so it went something like
integrated 1 > integrated 2> integrated 3/3STEM (if you did 3 stem you could skip)> integrated 4
i feel like doing ab bc in a year is nice since you'd only need 1 ap test, the bc one
i keep saying this but i really love this playlist
jennyyyy your lewis capaldi just came on and it's so goooddddddddd
doesn't this kinda look less like a robot and more like a creepy grin?
ahahaha which is exactly why i had to change my profile picture lmao
i kept seeing it as a creepy grin and it bothered me
here
lemme share a frog
üê∏ (2) 
i just drew it and was showing zoe
üíØ 
lmao
i mean i can draw you a frog sam, pick a hex code or something lmao and i'll use that color to draw a frog ig

i swear art class at some point just becomes, figure it out yourself class lmao

aerin1.txt_Files\image0-EDCE3.jpg
sammmmmm i wanna s e e e (if you're comfy ofc)
oh wow

finally the useless vocab i learned for art analysis critiques is coming into use ahahahah
oooh that one is so fluffyyyyyyyyyy
omg ahahahah
ahahah i found my out of season halloween costume i-
I FOUND PICTURES OF ONE OF THE CATS THAT LIVES NEAR ME
should i post the pictures?

lmfao
i searched up dog on google photos and a cat came up
i just searched up cats and there's a photo of a monkey i-
g u y s
i thought we were gonna test to limits of the spis spotify playlist
‚ÄºÔ∏è 
we might be able to if more than eight people contributed lmao
ü§† 
but we should still try and see how many we can get!!!
maybe the playlist would get long enough for a week :3
yeah only 9 hours lmao
sam this song is goooooooood :3
good to see you again! :3
zoe this song is good (let's b goblins}) it's so s o f t
some of these songs are so s of t
y e s also good morning zoe!!!! :3

good morning ethan & alexxxxxxx :3
zoeeeeee you also could have used the salute gif from cells at work :3
omg i can read the subtitles
it says you've worked harddddddddd ahahahah
at least i think it does
yeah that's the direct eng translation right? you've worked hard?
the platelets are so cute
i think i only read the manga
i feel cursed ;w;
i just read my brother's email draft
he really put a capital t after a comma i-
he's trying to get a class change done
my eyes have been cursed
i can already see my future, drowning in schoolwork and getting requests from my parents to look over his english essays before they get submitted
‚ù§Ô∏è
@jennosaur‚ô° ILYSM for adding so many songs also i love "got it in you" by banners i-
and bastille?! i-
hi jennyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
i heard that song on good doctor!!
i really like medical shows, i think it started from when i was a kid
my grandma had no idea what i was watching, but i ended up this old medical examiner show on discovery that was actually not my age... i think that't when it started lmfao
how's everyone doing? and please join us, we can talk about literally anything
i got so traumatized by monsters inside me or something
i- 
that's actually kinda mean
r i g h t ?
hi alexxxxxxxxxx :3
ngl the only grey's anatomy i knew for the longest time was that old medical textbook
opposites
who put chasing fire by lauv? it's so nice
yeah i think the show's name is from the textbook
my human anatomy prof recommended it as a supplementary read though i never read it
there are 162 songs, i don't really wanna scroll :3
i think the first time i heard lauv was when he did a song with troye sivan
i had my troye sivan phase in 8th grade or something
it's been years
lmao middle school
nostalgia really hits now ahahahahah
SAME
it's like discovering ancient history istg
fr fr
i'll be like w h y
like when i dug out/rediscovered the bracelets i bought years ago for bands i no longer listen to i-
i didn't realize how long i've been using spotify lmfao
i had a highly regrettable purchase when i bought a bunch of black butler posters
i never hung up the posters and i'm not about to take them with me to college aaaaaa idk what i was thinking
that too
now i have haikyuu stickers :3
i have the kind you can stick on the back of a card
don't think so?
i mean i've always loved ghibli and i watched it ages upon ages ago
plus i got into haikyuu in 8th grade lmfao
i really wanted a nostalgia trip so i watched ponyo + totoro this summer
y e s
i think so?
aw shucks i thought my new favorite animated movie in japanese was by ghibli & it's not
the boy and the beast
i thought of a really random question
do you remember which disney princess you wanted to be when you were a kid?
omg belle!!! that's a good one :3
mine was snow white i think
yeah it's really old now that i think of it
fr they areeeeeeeee
oml that's my gripe with so many storiessssssss
like now that i'm older and life happened, you end up being like why did they just magically get better and how?
not just sad but also morbid af
disney censorship
if i remember right, the original grimm's brother tale the mermaid dies and becomes seafoam
it's the premise ponyo is set around
not the whole dying thing though
it was really a dead dove: do not eat
wait which one?
dead dove: do not eat is a tag people use for fanfiction and works that are pretty much as labeled to warn readers that all the tags on the work are indeed as dark as the author has indicated
it's kind of a read at your discretion tag
it was taken from a tv show i think
lmaoo i know really useless things ahahah
sometimes it makes you wonder though
like the chemical hazards signs, does everyone actually know how to read that stuff?
i mean  i had to for school
yeah! the signs just specify what kind of dangers i think
i forget all the dangers but i know i got tested on them for whatever reason
i think the point is, be careful
did you all also have to do those lab safety tests?
well it might have been just my teacher since he was a retired industrial chemist or smth
well it might have been just my teacher since he was a retired industrial chemist or smth
yeah!!! that stuff and the rules for being in a lab
ngl i failed mine once
yeah apparently sometimes my common sense goes to sleep
fr fr
oh i failed that the first time too ahahah
i passed the second time
but i think it was only because my parents kept drilling it into my brain ngl
like we were in sf and my dad was grilling me on parallel parking on a hillside
yeah!! those
and then my brother kept laughing at me for forgetting the difference between high beam and low beam
lmfao
same though
okay now a really random question
what's everyone's favorite ice cream flavor
omg mint chocolate chip! same
so, uh, does everyone else just not eat ice cream?
üò≠ 
awwww see you later!!! :3
‚ù§Ô∏è 
oooh those are nice
also hiiiiii lydiaaaaa, nice to meet you!!! :3
it's all good!!! how has your day been?
awwww that's unfortunate. lab 3 or 4?
my day's been p good except for the part where i added a bunch more writing projects that i got to finish before september which was an oops
awwww hope the stress passes
and omg lab 3 was h a r d
i still have to do that, i'm just trying to kinda put it off for now lmao but i have a vague idea
as for writing projects, i promised a friend a few headcanons + a fic
and then i already have 3 i have to finish up :3
i have a few running at the same time, so majority is hp, there's one resident evil 8, and one haikyuu :3
ahahah i have a lot of respect for the people who read them ngl
i felt that
it's a wonder how i'm currently averaging 3k words per fic
bay area, san jose :3
wbu
oh that is so cool!!! :3
that is sooo good alexxxxxx
well it was between ucsd and cal poly and one had an aquarium
my mind gave me the mental image of you weaving in and out like you were driving in and out of different lanes
that's just kinda become my opener ahahah
no clue, my preferred face is :3
i'd use kaomoji but it's tiring having to switch between english and japanese on my phone
ahahah
i would but i also forget that i have short cuts so i disabled them :3
that is smart but i also sometimes just type a keyboard smash
oh yeah the slash commands
a lot of the discord bots are migrating over to slash commands as well
isn't there also one to reflip the table?
awwww cuteee
y e s
i still remember when people had to copy-paste those kind of things
hey alex, did i ask you how your day has been? if not, how has your day been? :3
oh that's great!! i'm doing p good as well :3
did you add any megan thee stallion songs to the playlist??
oh yeah i see it!! it hasn't come on yet so i couldn't tell ahahah
what's everyone's favorite season of the year?
hi timothyyyyyyyyy
also summer is quite nice for that reasonnn
wait sam, how 
also hi sammmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm üíú
wait lydia, why winter? temperature? weather?
how has your day been? :3
oh like how is it prettyyyyy
omg yeah they're really pretty
that's good! :3
lydiaaaa do you like snow?
ahahahahahah
what's your favorite thing to do in the snow, lydia?
fresh snow is so niceee but ski boots smh
do you do any snow sports?
ahhhhh sameee
well i'm glad you're alright now
i remember learning to ski, snowboard, and ice skate
yeah i started with ice skating and fell on my butt so often that i quit
sameeee
i just ended up tumbling and falling on my butt ahahah
see i did snowboarding cause i thought skiing was too hard
as it turns out, skiing was easier on my butt ahahahahahah
i swear it's so easy to fall over in skii boots because they really lock your ankles in ahahah
skii boots are really unforgiving smh
the snowboarding boots are much nicer
once i skiied into a hula hoop and i got a giant bruise from my skii boot
i mean i was moving kinda fast, but it was like my whole shin
it wasn't though
i don't get how i got a bruise when all that happened was a light thump sound
trueeee
what kind of hobbies do y'all have
i mean i write a lot, read a lot, learn a lot of random facts to fill the silence :3, talk way too much which is a more recent development, watch streams, and otherwise fill my time with something
omg stringed instruments are harddddddd
i've done guitar and violin and it's hard
i joined a server with an activity req and went crazy within three days
i'm like ranked 8th even though it's been less than a month, granted it's a small-ish server
i'm not v active in the c'o 2025 one lmao
me?
gimme a sec i gotta count
36 if we count this one
but if we subtract the two i've been using to play with bots that i own, then 34
although i might have miscounted ngl
but i think it's accurate
i mean, that could be a good thing
i have to stay on do not disturb because otherwise my discord notifs would be going off a lot
ahahah not really, a lot of the servers i'm in are big ones either for games or scans teams or just fandom servers
and some of them are old and kinda dead
i only really frequent this one and the guild server i have for a game where i have an activity req
honestly it was so active during the first few weeks and then died
kinda like a lot of the group chats i joined
probably my fault, i'm really chatty
ahahahah
i'm what you call  a chatty introvert
but i just passed the point of no return a week ago so i might be more of an ambivert now
lmfao
about a week ago i joined a guild for a game with an activity requirement
got panicked about the fact i'd have to talk and hit the requirement and then by the time i realized i was alright, i was already attached and had sent about a thousand messages
i mean i type pretty fast and i also have had a lot of practice
yes
and i procrastinate on essays
sooo
yeah
it's the only subject i can do minimal effort for
i mean i do creative writing outside of school, but besides that i'm stuck proofreading whatever my family says i have to and doing schoolwork
i don't understand how i write myself
i just sit down and start writing what i'm thinking
and then if it's for school, i jam in the quotes intermittently
that's so cool!!!!
oh that's super cool!
omg senioritis was the reason i was averaging 3k words in my ao3
my brain was like "why do the dracula essay when you could just write something entirely unrelated"
i used to struggle but now it feels too short if i write less than a thousand words
i get really bothered sometimes when i'm typing on discord and i hit the character limit but i'm not done with my thought
lots of times
i don't know
oh i spammed my friend once , i gave them 100+ notifs in an hour
i was in spanish with nothing to do
nah my friend has their phone on silent mode lmfao
i swear none of my friends feel lonely cause i'm so chatty smh
yeah *now* that i think about it, it is
okay same, but only when i don't know the other person really well and their reply habits
the friend i gifted with 100+ notifs has a really bad habit of forgetting to respond so i just kinda just do whatever pleases me  ahahah
lmaooo if you ever send me messages, promise i will reply lmfao
i have wayyyy too much free time
and even when i don't, i make it happen ahahahah
honestly it just sits in my mind bugging me if i haven't replied
so i try to get replies done before i entirely forget
okay but my parents leave me on read all the time
and so does my grandma
i'll text my grandma happy birthday or something and for days there will be nothing and then maybe a week later, there's a read thing on line
yeah and then she'll text me back much later in chinese even though she knows i can't read it
so i have to run it through google translate so google reads it to me
cause i can understand chinese but it's been years since i actually read chinese
idk it really depends
for one thing, if you have family who speak it, it's not that hard
and if you speak and asian language, it might actually be easier
like i don't really understand much japanese, but i've been watching a show and i can recognize some chinese characters and i've picked up a few phrases
tv shows definitely help, though there are so many shows with different dialects and from different countries that speak chinese
ahahahah it took me a while to recognize what the pinyin said lmfao
honestly i just don't remember most of the characters i learned before i quit in 6th grade
i used to go to tzu chi i think and omg it sucked
i probably speak taiwanese hokkien better than i do chinese
that stupid uniform
and those nasty navy pants
i remember how the teachers all wore literally the same thing
and i used to cause so much troubleeee
lmfaoooo
honestly the only thing i learned was that the class was boring
oh and the rewards they gave out sucked
the only thing i can do is speak
all my relatives speak full on chinese and when my mom yells at me, you bet she's screaming in chinese
ahahahah ap chinese
my brother's going to take that sometime
i did spanish for my foreign language
i thought it was easier cause i'm much better with my latin roots
perhaps, but i messed up when i didn't take ap spanish :p
i had to take the foreign lang placement but idk if i did okay 
my mom was like if you didn't do good, just take chinese and you'll be fine
i mean it'll probably be quite easy but yeah, sucks
i took 3 years of it to retake it potentially lmfao
wait ethan, can you speak taiwanese?
lmfaoooooo
whatever i've learned is from my older relatives speaking in taiwanese to gossip b/c some of my family can't speak taiwanese 
although i've also had a relative speak full blown taiwanese at me and i understood almost nothing lmfao
fr relatives are, they always think you understand more than you actually do
hi again jenny!!!
omg taiwanese is so hard to do pinyin for
i think there are more intonations or smth for it
i think the only perk of taiwanese is that other forms of hokkien are kinda similar to some degree
well that and if half of your family isn't able to understand it, gossip
ahahah my family mainly speaks taiwanese but my mom's brothers both married ppl who can't so their kids don't
so my grandpa is always telling me to call him yeye idk if that pinyin is right
even though i call him ah-gong which is taiwanese
oof i picked it up cause i was the only kid when i was born
my mom's side lived like in the area so they'd speak in taiwanese
i only learned that when i started going to chinese school and i told my teacher i liked my ah-mah and she was like wHaT?
omg i find it so frustrating when i have to explain who someone is relation to me in english
like my grandma's sister is my grandaunt in chinese but in english she's just my aunt or something???
it's really weird
honestly don't know, apparently all the forms don't allow for that?
right?
oh wow
ohhh that's kinda wild
i don't know my cousins on my dad's side too well ngl
not that i know any of my cousins too well lmfao
lmaooo i guessed it was that :3
and yeah!!! it's so hard to see family when they're in a diff country
c ov id
okay but did covid wreck anyone else's travel plan?
omg new zealand!!! that's where the hobbit set is!!!!
lmaooo they made that set in like the 2000s
that's actually pretty cool!!
i think my parents let me watch lord of the rings
i got hooked, read the books, and then ended up watching the hobbit trilogy when it came out
honestly the battle of five armies makes people cry
so there's a warning :3
honestly i remember crying over raya
ahahah
did you ever read eragon?
yeah it was one of the newer ones!!!
oh that's actually really fair
the series is *long*
in terms of page count
the movie was different from the book, idr by how much
okay this begs a very important question (i really hope other people answer too) 
what's a movie that made you cry?
artemis fowl will make you question what the heck disney is doing
the book and the movie are two different things entirely that only share one thing in common: the names of the characters
y es
i don't think i ever watched it
but definitely, if it's good, say so
are most people only here for open lab hours?
is that why it's just you & me in chat?
maybe we should temp move to dms until someone else joins lmfao
y e s
hi  again alexxxxxxx!!!
omg endgame made me so sad too!!!
ahhh that movie was a difficult one to watchhh
honestly i just c r y
jenny, i felt the whole wanting to watch the whole series
but my dad and brother kinda watched it without me  so i just kinda joined at random
the only marvel series i watched was the harley quinn stuff
idk i think marvel produced 2 harley films?
cause the new one that just came out is a dc film
yeah idk what was going on with that
cause some people i knew were chatting about the new suicide squad and saying it was funny that dc took the marvel director and marvel harley lmfao
honestly i don't remember
yeah i think the new one is in theatres
don't mind me and my weird spelling idk what happens but sometimes i switch between american spelling and british or something
lmaooooo
flavour and flavor
neighbourhood and neighborhood
the u sneaks in so often because i think during my troye phase he spelled neighbourhood with the u
honestly i just kinda go with my gut for spelling but i've also had plenty of correctly spelled words that i thought i misspelled
lmaooo
also not me having two different characters with one as my lock and one as my home screen
i swear piece trips me up so much
omg i type to fast and sometimes my keyboard can't keep up
awwwwwwwww that's so cuteeeee
autocorrect does me so dirty sometimes that i just turn it off and type whatever the heck i want
it'll autocorrect all the romaji i type and it just kinda goes downhill from there
also do you all have that weird thing where your phone recs you german or some european language despite your keyboard and your phone being in english?
my phone and ads think i'm google translate or something
my phone is like you must speak some random european language that you don't
and then i keep getting men's ads and ads in spanish
pretty much i just sit there barely comprehending what's going on
ahahah my phone recommends me two of my games
marketing really missed the target with me lmfao
i will say youtube screwed up theirs
i keep getting recommended stuff that i have never seen before
and their ads are all off
i can't count how many times i've gotten the same old spice ad
lmaooo i've never seen that
when i run out of posts from friends i just get cat pics
omg i want to disable snap's reels and stories
their recs for stories are just kinda weird and really clickbait-y
and a number of them are gross
i just dislike seeing the recommendations cause they have no taste
like at least instagram knows what i like lmfao
honestly i just have old ones
and wait
insta knows me too well
they recommended a reel of a cat crossing a basketball court
i have a bunch of cats in my neigborhood
there's a whole family that lives on my block
and then there are a bunch that i just see on occasion
omg that is so cuteeee
that's so cute
honestly i hope there are just cats wandering on campus
do any of the mentors know??? üëÄ
ahahah how though
hi zoeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
because they have perms
we don't
that's good, dinner is good
hi ethan, again
ahahh
raccoons could be rabid though
omg zoe y e s
i'll hype y'all up :3
i spend more time doing my demon voice than i do actually idk properly singing? so by the time i want to my voice is 
w r e c k  e d
wait john's in revelle?
üíõ 
i didn't know that ahahah
omg yayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy

üò≠ (4) 
jennnyyyyyyyyyy you're fun toooooo
lmfao

i thought it was hilarious
üíõ 
zoeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
üíõ (2) 
y e s
okay but waffle makers are useful
i think you can make pancakes without a machine
i just wanna bring a hot water boiler
hi timothy :3
we couldddd
make a card
an e-card
ohhh we could
as long as they get to keep it :3
it would be great
i remember doing this two summers ago, it was harddd
i had this writing thing and my mentor/teacher? would say the funniest and weirdest things so we tried to track it but it got hard after a few weeks
we kept it on a doc
but it was def hard to keep track of after a certain point
i found one of the things he said actually lmfao
?
ethannnnnn please explainnnnnn
on a less related note once the guy said ‚Äúi don‚Äôt know all the rules of your residential prison‚Äù
honestly looking at the doc where we kept the quotes we wrote for him brings back memories
that‚Äôs why we should do one for spis :3
just random quotes with no context
lmfaoooo
i just found these and cracked up ngl
yeah that one came into existence because i said i wrote poetry in the middle of the night lmfao
that would probably give you great poems though
sounds good
if we‚Äôre gonna bet i‚Äôd rather bet hugs or something lmfao
ahahahaha
no clueeee lmfao
i never played blackjack with bets
awwwww isn‚Äôt that carl?
from the carl bot?
i swear it‚Äôs the same turtle
idk lmfao
it‚Äôs cuteee
i drew frogs yesterday
lmaooo dw
ahahah then i'd have to redraw a giraffe and do it better this time lmao
omgggg i might join in watching unless i'm busy
and maybe i'll draw though i won't stream
i put bokuto on my lockscreen and now i wanna draw an owl
h e l p
yesssssssssssss
i put the post-timeskip bokuto one
aerin1.txt_Files\image0-202A8.jpg
this one :3
and now i wanna draw an owl smh
ahhhhh i can't do as many line breaks in drawing the owl ;w;
owl -> bird
:3
aerin1.txt_Files\Untitled_-_August_10_2021_20.40.28-EEE2C.jpg
lmaoo it took me a while b/c i wanted to keep the same art style
okayyyyyyyyyyy
i think i need to fix the angle lmfao
lmfao
okayyyyyy
i'll wrap it up then :3
i gtg
byeeeeeeeee
lmaoooo
i redrew the head cause it was disproportionate
so far
it‚Äôs finally done!!!
aerin1.txt_Files\Untitled_-_August_10_2021_21.34.51-27E10.jpg
@Cinnamon Bun ^
ahhhh i misssed coloring the mouth
lemme fix it
okay here‚Äôs the final one
aerin1.txt_Files\Untitled_-_August_10_2021_21.34.51-2ED12.jpg
i hope it looks okay ;w;
@Cinnamon Bun ^
it's there
it's under the mouth
no
okay okay fine
don't cryyyyyyyy
awwwwwwwwww
better?
aerin1.txt_Files\collab_with_zoe-E1804.jpg
nooooo don't be, it's okayyy :3
i-
why
lmaoooo
i mean i think it's fine as is lmfao
so i guess i can draw non-squishy animals?
it really is
so i guess our spis giraffe is done
i was about to say zebra even though i knew it wasn't a zebra i-
omg noooo
the pattern is harder
i thought we just agreed horses were hard zoeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
then why are we drawing horses againnnnnn
i-
y e s
frogs
lmaooo i can see it zoe
i bet there's someone here who can draw a horse better than me lmao
what gif?
also hi ethan :3
:3
that sounds fun
ikea has cool stuff
lmaoooooooooooo
wHat?
buying stuff for your dorm room?
omg lmaoooo
lmaoooooooooo
honestly i feel like i'd probably not be good at never have i ever
i've done a lot of pretty stupid things lmao
my brain just randomly went ‚Äúcards against humanity‚Äù
idk what it means but i played it once and it was interesting
oml i just realized my brother starts school today ahahahahah
i was so caught off guard b/c i didn't know what the cards were like
i mean it's high school?
yeah that made for an interesting few rounds where i was thoroughly confused
i didn't know the game was like apples to apples but adult ahahah
it was an experience to say the least
totally random but i swear so many people play genshin
oh you do? i died around twenty times in a row trying to complete the gliding permit's level 1 thing and then deleted the app lmfao
ü§£ (2) 
i mean everything else was fine except that it also managed to make my phone exceedingly feverish
i stuck to fgo after that
some girl i knew wanted me to cosplay a character from it
so i thought i'd check it out but yeah game was too hard :3
lemme look in my chats with a diff friend i think i found the name
but she has like pastel purple hair
yeah! her
idk why her of all characters
ohhhh
well i'm still not gonna do it lmao
i've had the experience of wearing fake ears
they weren't cat ears, but fox ears
and i also had a tail to match lmfao
is she just stabbing the slime?
wow
nothing it's been my halloween costume many times
it was once my brother's costume for his what does the fox say that practically all the kids his age did back when the song was big
once i passed it off as a kitsune costume
the rest of the time it was just a low effort costume for fun
i don't know her as a character + no clue what her voice lines are
it would be awkward if someone saw me and she was their fave character
oh and then i'd get worried that someone would ask me about the game ahahah
@Viridion ^ :3
so i've heardddd
do you have a favorite character?
i find paimon absolutely irritating
oh wow he looks cool
ohhhh that's interesting
i feel like he's one of those popular characters who has a bunch of fanfics
i know kaeya's also popular
ohhhh that's v true
i have some friends who like to whale on games
wow lmao
ngl i thought kaeya was a girl for a while
lmfao
kaeya seemed like one of those noveau ways of spelling kaya
i thought maybe he was just flat???
okay :3
hmmm should i do an appearance change and wear glasses tomorrow?
lmaooo guess i will then
i have a nice frame so it'll be fun
ahahah it can be one of those spot the difference games lmfao
unrelated but riot games really has life figured out
they started doing music and apparently now they're doing a show too?
meanwhile blizzard wow animatics are so nice
but they don't turn them into like actual movies
my 1 am complaints are weird as heck
yeah apparently
but ngl cgi is not their strong suit imo
it's actually their trailers for the games that rock
like the shadowlands patch for wow had some seriously great art and storytelling and voice acting
i think the game with the best cgi trailer i've seen would be the one made for diablo 4
i don't play either game
i ended up getting into the rabbithole of wow lore after i accidentally came across one of the videos
my dad played wow ages ago and he still plays diablo
oml league
i think i only got interested b/c of k/da + the lead singer for this band that i liked did a song with them
and then someone showed me that they somehow made a holographic dragon appear in a stadium which i thought was cool
but i had an ex who played league
ahahahahahah
what makes that a red flag?
oml lmfao
my brother did and he complained about it
i don't remember what his complaint was
wait then why do they still play?
okay but i kinda understand that sentiment
sometimes i really hate the games i play because i have to do so many events in a month
i guess it takes a real league player to explain how one can hate a game and still play it lmfao
lmaoooo i should do that
but it's hard to not play them ahsfklhsaf
ohhhhhhh
that makes sense
that just described animal crossing pocket camp
every month there's a new event with three parts
and every month i play it even though it's like a job
i tell myself i don't need every single stupid pixel furniture
but then i come up with another reason to play
although a lot of my old friends stopped playing :3
ohhh well all my friends were mainly adults who had lives outside of the game lmao
lmfao yep
i honestly ask myself why i still stay up late sometimes
lmfao
out of curiosity, how is it that you never sleep much?
that's fair
oml sameeee
i-
i couldn't do that i'm already tired from 7 hours
that's scary
honestly sometimes i use brute force to fix my sleep schedule
as alex h said, melatonin
it works but if you overtake them they won't
and then you'll have to hunt for the stronger alternative that i think is much harder to find
i have never taken more than 1 ngl
but i know an insomniac who kept upping their dosage and now the melatonin does nothing
honestly i think the only other brute force method is to make yourself tired by aggressively messing up your sleep schedule
i did that once and actually went to bed on time for the first time
lmaoooooo zoe
for whatever reason it feels like everyone and everything is so tall lmao
ohhhh wow
@Cinnamon Bun i forgot to ask this last night, what are we naming the giraffe?
w h y
does the name joe have some kind of significance lmao
lmfao
but it's a giraffeeeeeee
as my high school art teacher said, "a for effort"
yup (4) 
so i remember mentioning that i took a language placement test for spanish after i stopped studying it for two years
results are in and they really placed me in spanish 1c, hopefully after i take that my foreign lang is doneeeeeee
i guessed on quite a bit on it too i-
zoeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
hi
what are we naming the giraffe and are we taking suggestions
what's spin mean?
ohhhhhhh
lmaooooo
that's kinda cool
oh goodness i just realized the memory book channel now has pictures of me with my glasses ahahah
i think i've seen you with your glasses in a zoom session though
lmfao
yeah
i might just be really sleep deprived and confused then
i keep forgetting how much work glasses are ngl
i usually wear contacts
aw shucks i don't think anyone else i know is online besides you zoe ;w;
omg i heard they fog up so bad
ahahahah
but same
yeah it's because i stayed up that i have to wear glasses now :3
omg no same
but i've been wearing nighttime contacts for a long time
so usually i can see fine without glasses, i just skipped wearing them last night so i got to wear my glasses
ohhhhhh
my dad can't wear them either
i don't mind wearing my glasses though, i picked a nice frame this time lmao
they really are
lmaooo yes
how limited the amount of food i can eat is?
i don't have actual restrictions on what i eat, just self imposed stuff
oh for example, i don't like bell peppers because they have this smell that i hate
and then i don't like most smoothies because my mom has made really thick smoothies and i don't trust smoothies that aren't pink or purple-y
yeah i don't like bell peppers, refuse to eat most forms of garlic and onions, and almost never eat spicy food
i'm just odd
told you it was crazy :3
lmfao dw :3
@lyd hi lydia!! how has your day been?
how has your day been?
lmao i've been having a good day! it's been fun socializing!!! honestly never thought i'd say the second part lmao
hi jennyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
no clue ahahah
ohhh that's niceeee
how has your day been?
also i want to wear night contacts at school but that depends on how much sleep i average lmfao, i can't wear em if i sleep less than 7 hours
wait jenny do you also wear them???
ohhhh
but yeah fr it's a hassle to do contacts, much less in public bathrooms
also if anyone's lurking in the chat, please join ussssssssss i wanna try to get to know everyone in spisssss ;w;
‚ù§Ô∏è (2) 
omg pls be careful though
i scarred my cornea a few years ago and my optometrist is always like "the scar is still there"
i honestly don't know, i just had a hard time taking them out one day and then i managed to injure my right eye :3
that's why you gotta be careful cause if it happens too many times/a lot of damage happens no more night time contacts
yeah it really gets difficult
i can't imagine how cosplay contacts feel, esp sclera ones
also @Viridion hi!!!! how has your day been?
i don't know how people do those contacts cause i swear it's hard plastic in your eye
lmao felt that
lmaooo have funnnnnnnn :3
ahahah okay :3
i feel like most people are busy rn, though i don't know why
y e s ss
i hope more people slowly start to get active here in the chat :3
i want more friends to chat with ahahah
yeah mostly girls
so far i think i've seen a handful of guys drop by but not many
i swear this chat doesn't bite and i can make a bunch of puns related to cats and animals on purpose if that sets anyone at ease lmfao
oml that would be so helpful!!!!!!!!!!
yes and it would be great if it could get updates on wherever construction is
i think you'd need a few things
but otherwise it's pretty do-able
yes
it would be like waze but ucsd only
i think you might need a data set or take data from google maps lmfao
omg that's cool
but also, i would still get lost with the map lmfao
i wish it was an app
but honestly having a living breathing person is 100x better than a map
lmaoooo
sometimes i find myself forgetting my lefts and rights
ohhhhh that actually seems nicer and easier to use
i think that's all ux stuff then
i took a ux design class
lmaooo it could be cute
ahahah people are indeed difficult
especially eyes
i've seen many wonkily drawn humanoid beings
hands and arms though
i've seen those go wrong so many times
honestly just drawing is hard
that's cool
i like bones but not in that sense
i like the bones in human anatomy collections
lmaooo i did not
i learned the anatomical term which i also promptly forgot
but i still have my human anatomy coloring book
that last bit i felt
that's why i write and read fiction
i feel like fiction really gives you the snapshot into someone's mind
ye s
did you read any good books recently???
ahahah lmao
oooh tell me if it's good, i need to get back into reading cause i'm bringing some books with me to campus
lmaooo it is :3
maybe if i have a stove, the energy, and the time i‚Äôll make it and you can try it lmfao
i technically know how to make it
it does kinda sound like one ahahah
omg i just realized the giraffe is still nameless or do you normally not name the animals you draw?
hi ethannnnnn
when did we decide the giraffe was male
you and sam originally referred to the giraffe as him lmfao
that's not what the edited thing next to your message says lmfao
ethan that sounds like something a toddler would say after eating all the cookies before dinner
hi sammmmmmmm
lmfao
hi adriannnnnn :3
i'm from revelle! :3
okay i just realized that besides adrian, i only know one other person from muir that i can remember lmfao
omg lydiaaaaaaaaa hiiiiiiiiiiiiii
also adrian was just asking who was from muir!
yay i know three people!!! :3
i say just asking as if over 30 minutes haven't passed lmao
ahahahah honestly idk how many people i know from revelle
i've lost track of all the people who messaged me from diff group chats + instagram i-
i am not social actually
that was back when i was still kinda feeling awkward
these people just randomly messaged me i-
yes :3
lmao
and i gained like 300 followers after committing to ucsd, it was kinda terrifying
angrycloudkitty
and ofc my username has something to do with cats lmfao
already approved it lmao & send a request back ahahah :3
i spent a lot of my summer just following people back
and getting messages
and answering them i-
honestly i blame myself for being like lemme post an intro!
ahahah i was quite impulsive and did it
and then i basked in regret as the messages came in and people thought i was interesting enough to message
i wasn't emotionally prepared for people to actually message me though ;w;
it's fine no one messages me anymore, even those weird scammy sugar parent accounts
well i had a a female person message me and i've had a male person message me too
so i figured parent was most inclusive
i think the most awkward convo i had was one where someone reached out to me about lore for middle earth despite only watching the movies
either way
i think it's more fun getting to know everyone here!
i wish more people who are online would talk h e r e
i swear i say this so often
yeah omg that discord is huge and i just kinda don't have the energy to keep up with all those people
i get kinda curious sometimes as to why people don't chat here more
i mean originally i didn't cause it was really really really dead lmfao
that would make for an interesting question to pose
okay but i like to think that i'm capable of talking to almost anyone so long as there's a shared language
oh and i can't be anxious either
but if both conditions are met, whatever people want to talk about at the very least, i'm willing to listen to hours upon hours of their interests
hello ethannnnnnnnnn
i have very rant-y relatives so i can handle hours of stuff i don't understand or know much about
it wasn't by choice tho
~~i learned to sew because i wanted to~~
yikes my friends from a diff gc are telling me i'm not active enough oops
oh it's half alive half dead
i apparently haven't been replying to messages
okay but lowkey is anyone else left handed here?
usually i can see people's handedness irl but can't really see that on zoom, same with height ngl lmfao
hi jennyyyyy
also warning: i took a melatonin to ensure i go to bed sometime early so i might disappear
that's so interesting!!
i type a lot so i am very quick with my words
i learned how to use a mouse and draw with one using my right hand but i do practically everything else with my left hand
i mean i could see you were typing :3
well i can't exactly use power tools without being extremely careful
:3
they do but it's uncommon
usually if you go out places, then you end up seeing the right handed mouse
i also learned to flip right handed scissors
i have to turn them the other way
like usually you hold them one way, i use them in the mirror of that
i'll just take a picture
aerin1.txt_Files\image0-8F7CD.jpg
usually people use it the other way
i mean that way
ugh my brain
i flip it
so you see
like the other side
hi sammmmmmmmm
who me?
i have an average of about 60 wpm
i mean it fluctuates
idk i could check i still have the results i had to submit for a class i took
oops
it was 65 wpm with a 98% accuracy
it was the one minute test
i highly doubt i could do the 30 second test and have a decent accuracy
i had to do one minute because my prof said so
it was for a transcription class
ooooh niceeeeeeeeeee
what's your wpm?
yeah it was medical healthcare transcription, i originally took it to learn about chart notes cause i was curious
it was pretty fun lmao sam types hella fast
i know right?
honestly i've just given up and started going with y'all and everyone
same but also some ppl have dysphoria
i honestly just go with whatever pops in my head first lmfao
if i don't know what to do i usually just insert either a meow or something cat related
it's solved all my problems so far
i don't see why it can't continue to :3
lmfao i think the most random thing i started saying recently is ara ara~
and that's because the bot that tells me i've leveled up says ara ara~ so i reply with one too
because i talk to bots
lmfaoooo
nya is not one of the things i would say
someone replied to me with that once though
i also accidentally caused my guild to go a tiny bit crazy :3
okay i should really sleep i-
ahahaha
lmfao i remember people would overuse xD
wild times
i probably shouldn't have posted my lazy halloween costume, i'll prob never hear the end of it hahah
oh my fave thing is the cat face :3
i do it all the time
idk about that people went crazy over it
not that i get why
nope
it‚Äôs just me with a pair of fox ears and a tail
nothing special lmfao
it isssss
best halloween costume ever
i think i originally took the pictures just in case my middle college yearbook didn‚Äôt have enough halloween pics in my junior year
but it was never used ahaha
lmaooooo i was in yearbook so i kinda felt bad for the halloween team and was gonna submit it
but they got it figured out
i‚Äôm gonna go for the night, goodnight everyone ! :3
good morning zoe!!! :3
good morning sam!!!! :3
good morning alexxxx :3
omg zoe that‚Äôs so cuteeeee
also no mentors are on rn
okay that‚Äôs really cute :3
y e s
there‚Äôs also ev 2 to do
true
was it? lmao oops
it sounds like multiplication though
when someone says ‚Äúproduct‚Äù doesn‚Äôt that usually mean multiply?
it sounds like they‚Äôre asking you to make sure that you find the pair of numbers that make the largest positive product
i interpreted that as either submitting [4,1] or just [4] since it's four that maximizes not really 1
but it could also be what alex said
no problem :3
zoe, we have discussion in 2 minutes, you could ask for clarification then :3
either i can't spell or google can't spell
i swear we spelled the same thing i-
i don't know what happened
i knowwww
i-
oh well, can't drive anyway
they need a giant parking structure
omg yes
and i hope they make it a pretty parking structure too
my lungs hurt from laughing i-
hi jennyyyyyyy
okay so it wasn't a breakout room
i dropped by acm and then went back to main session
and gary was there
and it was great :3
yes
he was hanging out in the main room lmfao
i wasn't sure if i wanted to check out any of the other groups so i took a break there
and then gary appeared
and then i never left ahahah
honestly same i kinda got hit with zoom fatigue
which is weird cause usually i'm in front of my computer for hours
i thought my humanities were waived for revelle and they weren't
instead they waived my sciences
why does discord have such weird emote names
like why is disappointed_relieved a thing
ahahah same i haven't actually given it any thought lmfao
i need to do that
ahahah i'm looking at their default plan and crossing off a bunch of whatever doesn't apply to me which is a fair bit
ohhhh that's a fair concern
a trick i've seen some students do is take some ges at community college over summer
idk where they were in their progress towards graduation but it was something i saw often during summers
i'm actually kinda curious about the hum classes
i only got 1 waived
yeah
i took more than enough college classes to technically have them all waived
but they were like nope
you can check your degree audit
that's how i found out revelle decide to take my science instead of my humanities
the degree audit is in tritonlink :3
honestly i'm so glad they took my science, my chemistry and physics were not fun
plus the physics i took wasn't lab physics ahahah
but idk what to expect with humanities ahahah
ahahah
i'm like humanities > stem because i can make more things up ahahah
oh wow
that's super niceeeeee
i have to retake calc bc since i dropped it a while back
i'm looking at the humanities sequences for revelle
and they're kinda funny
it's like whap
honestly it all sounds like history
i did quite well in whap so i think i'll be fine
depends what classes
^^^
ohhhh specialization!!! which one???
ohhhh that's nice
practically everyone i know is like TAKE A CS MINOR WITH YOUR MAJOR
so watch me not sleep :3
it's fine though cause i know a few other night owls lmfao
i mean i figure as long as i pass the math classes, i can make my humanities carry my gpa lmfao
can anyone from revelle tell me how hard the humanities reqs are?
ahahah
good luck jennyyyy
oh okay then that's not that bad at all lmao
i took the college equivalent of ap lit so i think i should be fine
üëç 
you could always email them!!!
üíõ 
i'm p sure you need to email your college's advisor
i'm finally planning things out and i keep smudging my writing i- 
;w;
that's honestly a great idea lmao
i would if i didn't particularly prefer paper
we need that
i will probably have really random questions
also i just looked at my remaining revelle ge's and i don't have much lmao
y e s
lmaooo zoe i technically will have six years of college by the time i graduate
not sure how lucky that is lmfao
ohhhhhhhhhhh that's cool!
i spent 2 years as a full time cc student :3
while in high school ofc
honestly though cc is wild, i had one cc on semester and that was my main one but i also did some classes with a diff one on quarter and their breaks *never* aligned
ahahah i forgot about those despite getting pings for it ahahah
so according to what i heard yesterday at the revelle thingy i attended they said we don't have a first and second pass for this upcoming enrollment
but if you're not sure, you should def drop by your college's web registration webinar or watch the recording if they have one up
also hi josh :3
wow now you're orange!!!
because time flies :3
i had all summer to sleep
but instead i stayed up late
i napped *sooooo* much during my final semester of high school, i can't tell you what was happening in any of my classes
josh, are you in a different time zone or do you just like staying up late?
i usually see you're still on at like 1-2 am
ohhhhh that makes a lot of sense, i'm usually up at that time unless i've brute forced myself into sleeping earlier
you should join our 12 am convos if you have timeeee
i think i finished planning my four years, my brain hurts and unless i space things out i'll be graduating by fall 2024 i-
hi alexxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
i have to space stuff out but it would be with a bs in cog sci w/ my specialization + cs minor
all that's contingent on me actually getting classes as planned
but i had 90.5 units to start
i'm not lmfao
i have to put in some of those "fun" classes because rn it's just jam packed full of my major + proposed minor classes
i just didn't put in the "fun" classes cause lazy
i only put one and that was literally a marine bio class
i feel *slightly*  pressured by my parents to take a bunch of cog sci electives
omg film sounds fun!!!!!!!!
yeah i think i have a few too many cog sci electives on my thing but i also stopped counting cause it got difficult
sql? isn't that a language?
‚ÄºÔ∏è 
i only know some languages by name cause i've heard them mentioned in passing lmfao, sql was one of them
hi sam!!!
i'd ask my brother for you since he knows more coding than i do, but i think i thoroughly traumatized him last time asking him to check what i was coding in python
he's supposed to be taking a java class
sometimes i look at sql and my brain goes "squirrel"
i just looks so much like squirrelllllllllll
i had a realization
if i did math as much as i write, maybe i wouldn't have forgotten all my calculus
it still exists
#pet-pictures
np :3
anyone do anything interesting today?
honestly the most interesting thing i did was draw a cat 30 minutes ago
it does, i still can't drive :3
i've seen people play it, it's very bloody :3
also hi ethan, sam, and zoe
my mom was yelling at me half the time when i drove one time
that reminds me i gotta brute force my sleep
maybe all asian mothers share one brain cell to scream at children learning to drive lmfao
i don't really see any rush to learn though
i won't even be taking a car to sd anywayyyyyy
technically i only need to learn enough to pass the driving test
if i can pass then i can get my license
and not drive
y'all wanna see the cat i drew?
aerin1.txt_Files\image0-C59CF.jpg
don't mind the fact that i drew this on the back of my four year plan
y e s
i saw a picture of a cat with a bear hat thing
but  couldn't figure out how to do the bear hat so i did a frog hat
zoeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
i wanna watch you guys playyyyyyyyyyyy
i knowwwwwww
y es
and ping meeeeeee :3
idk i like watching games more than i like playing them
right the lecture
i know i should be getting to bed buuuuuuuuuuut also staying up late
i sit in a chair for hours and i feel nothing lmao
ohhhhhhhhhh
lmaoooo
i think the only embarrassing thing that could pawsibly happen rn would be me making random faces at the camera
idk where i show up on zooms for everyone else, but if i think no one is watching i make a weird face
well it's funnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
plus if someone does catch me making a funny face, i bet it makes them laugh
ohhhh that's fair
yes they dooooooooo
i like looking at people's backgrounds
especially when they swap them around
yayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy that's great!!!!!
idk what i'm doing this quarter
i made and promptly forgot what i'm taking
like i have the thingy and then i forgot
i think picking classes isn't that scary compared to everything else
well it's somewhere
i don't remember but i know i did it
well at least you had fun!!!
also hi lydia!!! :3
oh that reminds me zoe, are you going to get back 4 blood?
really? i must be desensitized then
isn't it the game that comes after dead by daylight or did i remember wrong? it's been a while
that is fairrrrrrrrrrrrr
oh college is social time for me
so trueeeeee
i think commuting can change the experience you have though
cause my local school is sjsu and it's a full blown commuter school
so it's a lot more like a community college where everyone just goes to class and that's it
that is also trueeeeeeeeeee
oh fr it is crazy expensive
yes
it is stressful
oh btw i got my zombie games all muddled apparently back for blood was the one after left for dead or something
i think i've seen someone play it?
yayyyyyy go zoe!!! :3
i think i watched dead by daylight 2 once
i need to check
yeah i saw dead by daylight 2 last month
it was indeed difficult
oops
ugh
my brain did another inside out thing
i give up
it was left for dead 2
why am i like this
i guess it makes sense since it was so bloody
like the left for dead was bloody and so was back for blood, i should have knownnnnn
oh that is cool!!!!!!!!!
i just googled it and i think i've seen the cover around but never the game
i think the first horror game i ever saw played was outlast
awwwwwwwwwwwwww
then i think after that it was silent hill series
you used to play?
also hi sammmmmmmmmm
lmaooooo
oooh she's prettyyyyyyyy
i only really remember the k/da members lmao
she looks magicalllllll
lmaoooooooo
oooh she can flyyyyyyy
actually those six wings remind me of the key for resident evil village
that's the six winged key from resi 8
ohhhh yeah those kinds of people suck
for the longest time i only knew one person who played league and he had *i s s u e s*
oh my! that's not good 0-0
they can be
i don't know, my biggest mistake was dating that dude
and then i dumped him
and now he stalks me
lmaooo zoe
it;s the same dude though
he's the creepy stalker dude who sent me his contact info a year after i blocked him
unfortunately, one of the other girls he stalked said that police did nothing
and what he did with that person was wayyyy worse cause he knew where they lived lmao
i'm in no immediate danger lmao
~~he should have been arrested a year ago but wasn't~~
it's no biggie
i knowwwwwwwwwwwwwww
pfft i have four exes and he's the only one creepily attached but it's fine
i know
but it's fine
i know what goes on in his brain
he'll let go of me pretty soon cause his "dream" is to find his "the one" at college at a bus stop
i highly doubt i'm in any danger
i'm leaving in a little more than a month :3
he's not going to come to ucsd lmao
i already had my school's counselor block where i'm going to college
yeah!!! dw though, i'll be all good :3
but zoeeeeeeeeee
i *am* an adult
i know
honestly idk if he stopped or not lmao
ahahahahahah
then how old is a true adult
lmaoooooo
i‚Äôm not sure if i wanna join that club yet :3
i‚Äôm probably going to wait until i‚Äôm on campus to decide what clubs
not particularly tbh
i don't think every club you join has to be related to your major thoughhhhhhhh
i remember when one of the ucs visited my school they said they had a costco club
it isssssssssss
i used to always go to the books section
their muffins are biggggggggg
wow that's a long time
still,,, isn;t that around 11 hours
i say that like i don't have disordered eating
disordered eating just means i don't eat on a regular schedule
sometimes i eat all three meals and sometimes it's just one
lmaoooooooooooooo
oh bagels are fun!!!
hi lydiaaaaaa dw
there's no such thing as a passed topic
time doesn't really function in my brain anyway
hi jennyyyyyyyyyy
i took my melatonin so i might disappear when it hits me hard
i knowwwwwwww
omg me with fgo
i'm not tired yetttttt
hi ethannnnnnnn
nothing much, ethan, wbu?
oml ff14
i know some people who play i think
lmao
my brother spent a long time picking a gaming mouse
and i didn't get it
i also heard gaming pcs are different from regular pcs
but i don't build the pcs in my family, my dad does
i think the shells are really pretty
that would be hard for me to type with
my hands are small
wait what's this mean?
oh that's v important!!!!
i had a scare for arthritis/carpal tunnel and yeah
using stuff that's good for your wrists is v v v important
ohhh i have never seen that before
my brother types fast but it's only aswd according to him
that's literally the only part of the keyboard he's fast with
so i laugh at him cause i type way faster with all the letters
s u r e
i mean i've seen some disassembled before?
plus my dad built the one i use when i'm not on the laptop
i'm still not tired lmaoo
but good night zoeeeeeeeeee
lmaoooo
n o
not banished
we thought you were tired??
i am a terrible example
nooooooooooooo
lmao
goodnighttttttttttttttt
s a m
it's night somewhere else in the world
let me pretend it's night
i-
good night to you too ethan
s l e e p
that's a big oop
and also why i refuse to say when i'm going to bed
no one has fixed my sleep schedule and no one shall lmaoooooooooooooo
ahahahahahah
i always tell myself that
and then a week later i'm back to going to be past 1 am
lmaooooooooo
idk why i like being up late so much, i also can't see anything when it's dark
one thing i've learned is no night classes
most of the time you end up sleeping
the professors are super boring
mind you i was taking math night classes
it's so hard to stay awake and also imagine walking back to dorms in the dark
i said that too and then i fell asleep in my calc bc
and had to drop
i remember having a 9 am discussion last year and it sucked
honestly i don't want early classes cause it's cold in the morning
i don't really like cold weather
i've been outside a classroom in the middle of winter so i decided never again
wow you're gonna be walking far, ethan
i should honestly check
but also do i really want to
ahahahah i'm retaking all my math :3
i-
we have bedtime now?
alsooooo good morning everyoneeee
ah that‚Äôs fair lmao
i think some of us could do with more sleep ahahah
omg sammmmmmmmmm
good morning alex!!! :3
ahahahah sameeeeee
i swear the weeks are just flying byyyyyyyyyyyy
s a d
;w;
i like hanging out with everyoneeeeeeeeeeee
i don't want it to endddddddd
that is trueeeeeeeeee
that will be so fun!!!! :3
f u n :3
that would be quite fun!!!
great idea jared!!! :3
i remember hearing about people doing bonfires at the end of a semester to burn all their notes and stuff lmao
ahahahah that sounds so simple
i'm not allowed to
my mom really said i can't burn anything b/c i have a younger sibling
that is hilarious
i was so bad at the act math it wasn't even funny
i had to take my last one at a hotel near sfo
omg same
4 2 3 6 7 9 4 8 6 4 2 3 9 1 7 9 2 5
i tried to count them zoe
lmaoooo i honestly stopped caring once the test was over
lmaooooooooooo true
i spent a whole five minutes thinking of a word that starts with d
and the only thing my tired brain came up with was divine
ahahaha
is anyone going to dress up for the closing ceremony today?
i mean it also says spooky attire
üëç 
oooh that sounds fun!! i'll look forward to that then lmao
i don't think i ever did a spooky halloween costume
i have old masks but they're dusty
i have my old halloween costume sitting next to me
wait zoe, if you don't wear it, i wanna see a pictureeeeeeeeee
yayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
i already put on half of my costume for fun since no one will be able to see it as long as my background is on lmao
right??? zoe's mask is probably super cool!!!
ohhhh that seems cool!!! :3
aaaaaaaaaaa it was so nice seeing everyone!!! :3
hato (2) 
might want to ping in case this chat is muted :3
i'm so glad i can take off my headband nowwwwwwww ajkfldsfa
fox ears
üíú
caleb, it works :3
lmaoooooooooooooo
hi zoeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
:3
doesn't that kinda depend on the ingredients you have though?
rice cookers are the bestttttttt
idk how people cook rice on a stove ngl
who?
oh i might cause i can make other stuff with it
but idk
that's something my mom will tell me lmao
tbh i'm not going to worry too much about it
i don't think i will be cooking much anywayyyyyyyyy
oh wowwwwwwwww
from what i remember reading i think it's based on where you're staying
some have kitchens on their floor and others don't
yes, what zoe said
atp gives me flashbacks to cell bio i-
ucsd likes being a mystery
but it's also giving me procrastination vibes?
i-
my brain is just switched half off ahahah
yeah
i'll hang out with you zoeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
zoeee we should figure out were we both are staying so we can visit each other!!! :3
my enrollment is safely at 9 pm lmfao
üò≠ (5) 
john, we don't have perms
what doomboat?
is it pretty?
ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
ahahahah
sometimes i ask myself why goldfish and cheese-its taste different
ahahaha
hi zoeeeeeee
lmao zoe, out of context this is all quite confusing :3
ahhhhhhhhhhhhh i knew it was stupid to start watching outlast, especially a no commentary version
how's saturday going for everyone?
that's wonderful alexxxxxxxxxxxxx :3
ohhhhhhh that's so cute zoeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
‚ùó 
i just noticed something really weird on the poll, it's logging 6Ô∏è‚É£ twice as a reaction
lmao diego, i wasn't even on here for the last hour
jenny, i checked though
both of those said `:six:`
awwwwww
i‚Äôm just skipping it lmao
there's a valorant tournament happening soon-ish 
it's in the c/o 2025 announcements - if anyone wants the link to sign up lmk
lmaooo i gotta do aps as well ahahah
maybe take a small nap and then go back to it
y e s
even melatonin can't win against my will sometimes ahahah
okay but my mom too
ahahahah
if i can force myself to not sleep after getting my covid shot, i think it's gonna take a lot more work to get me to sleep normally
technically, i *could* wake up early and it would be much better for me than staying up late (i've tried both)
buuuuut staying up late is more convenient
plus it's cold in the morning often
ahahah i was supposed to be good at bio :3
but i also ignored most of the things i learned from bio
by much better for me, i just mean that i can get the same things done that i do at like 12am but with less trouble
so if i really wanted to do things "properly" i should go to bed early and wake up at like 5 to 6 am
same ahahahahah 
i rarely do things early because my brain can't think of anything lmao
i didn't pay attention once things went online in spring 2020 ahahahah
i took human anatomy then and then cell bio
i remember almost nothing from both
ahahahaha i felt that
i'm so glad no more science classes for me ahahah
well i magically finished my science reqs
@jennosaur‚ô°  look at this
r i g h t?
aaaaaaa
they should really put that on the error 404 ahahah
a c at
honestly i should do aps but watching ethan fight lady dimitrescuuuuuuu
fun fact mosiac is such a wonky name that google maps doesn't recognize
but gary did say that you can leave classes early to get to the next one
yeah they really are
the placement is also weird
some classes have discussion afterwards and then the discussion is a whole 16 minutes away
as if that was logical
wait they are??? i thought they weren't aaaaaaa
well ofc but if it's not mandatory üëÄ
i won't have to stress myself as much over time conflicts if they aren't ahahah
a r g h
okay
not bad
lmaooo aps
i just type giant paragraphs as fast as i can
but it definitely shouldn't take too long since there are only four actual problems
then i have to redo my four year plan again before i finish watching outlast 2
on a far less related note, how's sunday going for everyone?
earlier today (as in like 12 am) i finished watching outlast whistleblower so that was nice but also absolutely terrifying ahahah
otherwise it's a good day cause i'm gonna try to get my aps done fast
how was it, ethan?
that's goood :3
i think omakase is like chef's pick if i remember right
idk it came up in animal crossing
lmfaooo i swear every drama has that moment
also yes, outlast is a horror game, i decided to watch it all before school starts
oooh that sounds cool
oh i don't eat raw fish but for a different reason
i thought too hard about disney movies and now i ruined it for myself ahah
same i don't really like fish that much
i remember watching this tv show where people got parasites from eating raw fish
since then, i have never even considered raw fish worth the risk to eat
lmaooo ethan
honestly at this point i feel like making sushi would be cheaper than buying it
but also can't drive
idk from what i remember it costs my mom less to go to mitsuwa to buy fish there and make sushi over going to a restaurant
lmao
kappa sushi is p chill
or the inari sushi
wait what about the ones with fish roe like the tobiko and stuff
it is until you have too many
what?
lmaooooooo
i don't usually trust airport food ngl
same
but i also haven't been traveling
usually i go to the san jose airport tbh
i like airplanes for whatever reason but i also usually never sleep on them ahahahah
awwwww i'm glad that's no longer the case
honestly when the plane is leaving the ground and landing are my least favorite parts
it's like riding a rollercoaster tbh
ahahah i'm so bad with rollercoasters because i don't scream, i just have an apparently very terrified expression as i cling to the friend next to me for dear life
but i get on them anyway
i'm just really quiet but clinging like a drowned cat
okayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy :3
pretty much just questioning its existence lmao
lmaoooo
at least it's all sushi ingredients
i've also seen a recipe for a sushi cake actually
it doesn't look like cheese ?
i don't think so, the texture just looks off for cheese lmao
it almost looks like how imitation crab looks but it's def not imitation crab
oml i just remembered i need to finish transferring recipes i-
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa i was supposed to do that this summer
yeah i had some recipes on nyt that i want a permanent copy of
i have like 100 pages of recipes from cookbooks and stuff
it's honestly really soothing typing recipes
idk i also like spending time looking through recipes and the comments
yeah most of the comments are either saying what to change to the existing recipe or that it works or that it's a massive fail
quite helpful ngl
but usually when i have to type recipes it's because it's a physical book
but that makes it less funnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
i like typing it
plus i have a specific formatting thing that i've been doing
ahahah
hi alex w and alex h!!!!
and y e s
move in day is kinda exciting
oh that is so cool!!!!!
that is also really cool
ahahah
my aps was questionable
i wasn't tired enough to actually come up with good explanations
i did it ethan :3
lmao same
who is mark rober?
ohhhh cool
that kinda reminds me of julia tries on delish's youtube
how has today been for everyone?
that's niceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
@Cinnamon Bun i understand how you feel now having to push things back b/c of precalc
my sleep deprived brain didn't realize last week that i might have to take four more math classes so now i'm looking at seven math classes aaaaaaaaa
i have to take 20A-E and then 18 and then 180A at the moment
but i did ask in a different server if it's absolutely necessary
i would like to just take 20A, 20B, and 18 in the ideal situation
honestly this is exactly why the cognitive science 118 courses are going to be the death of me
hi alexxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
oh that sounds nice alexxxxxxxxxx
hi lydiaaaaaaaaaaaaa
actually is anyone else cognitive science and planning to specialize in ml?
i am genuinely curious as to how everyone else is going to handle the cogs 118 stuff
the 118 reqs are weird
like grad reqs don't say you have to take that much math
but then you still do?
i'm really trying not to look at my four year plan rn ahahahah
hi jennyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
smart smart
i didn't want to replan so my backup plan is if i cannot pawsibly convince the professors for 118B and 118D to let me take two less math classes, is probably going to either be changing specializations or just getting my b.s. with no specialization
the only reason i even need math 20e & 180A is for that one req for the two mandatory cogsci 118A/B/C/D courses
maybe? idk i planned in a potential cs minor when i was doing it
but now my seven or more math classes will probably be keeping me stressed and occupied ahahah
i mean i saw that cs majors also have a bunch of math
but i also feel like a lot of them got more math waived than i did
i literally just have calc 10a waived
LOVE THAT
i'm going to assume i can graduate in 4 years since ucsd did admit me and all
but still i'm giving them my squintiest of squinty eyes
i swear it's so convenient having that minor and doing the ml specialization
imagine if i have to take math over summer
i will cry
if everything works out nicely then it would be so easy to complete the minor ahahah
but how are they doing it is the real question. like what if they're doing full loads every quarter including summer -0-
i mean next summer i have to take spanish so i don't have to take it during the year
i have to take around seven math classes
plus everything else
maybe? idk
i won't worry too much about that
i'm more concerned about graduating in four years ahahahah
niceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
a lot of my credits are general elective credits so they count for nothing that i'm aware of lmfao
i have 32 units of electives that aren't upper division
they're mainly ges
yeah i have like three left
but i'm freaked out over all the lower division reqs i have before i can take some of my upper division courses
yes i ammmmmmmmmmm
ahahaha i hope so
which college are you in?
ohhhh niceeeeeee
is anyone else having a hard time finding "fun" classes?
i'm slowly going through the entire course catalog trying to find something
honestly that does sound fun, except i get the feeling there would be some papers involved
hi again lydia!!!
i am so scared of actually having the fun ones displace my lower division reqs
hi joshhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
also that is nice advice
^^^
i'm planning four years, hence my panic
i have to redo my four year plan
rn i just have my checklist done with all the courses and backups
well for one thing, parents
and also because i will forget i had plans and then when it's time to make decisions i will probably freak out
so it's just best i have the idea of what i can/should do
esp cause my goal is to keep my major and not change it lmaooo
pretty much once i finish planning, it'll be past the point of no return
some of them are so nice
their only req is upper div standing
i'm really indecisive so i'm just going to stick with my major and tough it out ahahah
also like psych has so many ud courses that are cog sci approved electives with no or almost no prereqs
hi zoeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
i don't remember how to read notes
i'm literally going through the course catalog to find things
i hope both of you get the music classes y'all want :3
i've been thinking, maybe skip the whole fun classes entirely and just do all my lower division reqs
me feeling weirdly excited about revelle's humanities sequence
ahahahah
lmaooooooooo
ahahaha
betrayed^
ahahah
zoeeeeeeee are you going to take hum 2 when it's available in spring?
i felt that too
i thought you could only transfer 1 hum course?
i only got 1 waived
so i still have to take 4 or 5
i-
you know what
hum can be my fun class
it's probably the only humanities i will be taking ahahah
i'm just banking on knowing some stuff from whap
ap world history
yeah cause they slap you with a bunch of info
yeah same
it's faster to type whap
oml same
oh that's niceeeeeee
oh those were a total pain to find
the sheets
SAME
i haven't packed anything i-
ohhh cuteeeeeeeeee
hi again joshhhhh
there are literally piles of stuff in my room
i just have this pile of stuff for college and half of the items are kinda getting dusty
i have like five books
ohhhh that's smart
i just used a list i found from the c'o 2025 discord
both
apparently
ngl my parents are making most of the executive decisions on what i'm bringing and buying lmao
i saw calculators
san joseeeeeeeee
if you're taking more math, you need calculators
graphing and maybe scientific was what the list i was looking at said
but the type depends on the class
i hope none of the maths i have to take need a scientific calculator
i gave mine to my brother and i don't trust it now that he's used it for a couple of years
i'm going to wing my first quarter
lucky you ahahah
my parents will be mailing whatever i forget over ahahah
okay but of all the people i know who are in college
i have yet to hear of one dying of stress
so maybe it'll be okay
i think i kinda know but it's okay cause google and upperclassmen
if anything it seems like everyone's having fun???
i'll have to remember to do school
it's so easy for me to not do school
wait what major???
ohhhhhhh
that's niceeeeeeee
ohhh that's kinda cool lmao
previously i thought maybe architecture
i took one look at the application which ofc asked for a portfolio and was like "okay what's another major i can do"
honestly i kinda think the design specialization would be fun
but also
oh my
i couldn‚Äôt figure out how to say it
i think the best way to put it is that design specialization usually ends with people in the ux/ui design field as far as i‚Äôm aware
but i don‚Äôt know how that fits with what i wanna do after i graduate
i say this to myself too
i felt that zoe
jenny, alex h, and i are
sam are you also cog sci?
ohhhhh
it‚Äôs okay zoe :3
it was quite close lmaooo
you know what i wanna know? how much fun do disney imagineers have?
okay but zoe, good job
cause if that helps you feel better
it‚Äôs for a good cause
same
you‚Äôd be a very pretty and nice rock
my brain is liquid slush
lmaooo jenny
oh which lab are you on?
ohhhhhhh
ohhh we had problems with that
turns out we messed up
not really messed up
we missed something lmao
jenny aren't you and your lab partner on lab 6 though
wait how do you have two images?
you should only have one?
wait what
you're supposed to i think?
ohhh lmaooo
well dw you have this week to get it done
ours looked 600 x 800 despite the fact it wasn't
we just left it as that
and we moved on
wait what do you mean by that jenny?
my brain is buffering hard
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa good luck
ohhhhhhhhh
oh wow that's a lot
okay but my brother just started learning to use photoshop and i've just been dead inside
ye s
^^^
i'm sure your teacher will understand though
actually i just realized i don't think i've seen an art history course yet ahahahah
zoe, maybe a break would be good
cause it sounds like you need one
yeah aps is due sunday lmao
lmao jenny
you just named something other than pygame that we learned
sorting
pygame feels like scratch
but harder
i'm honestly just learning from the labs
i feel like doing it is easier than actually learning it from lecture
okay but i almost never move around when i'm home
i finally started understanding the errors recently
and since then it's been niceeeeeeeeee
i can technically walk more than  100 steps a day
but i also don't want to
^^^^
i used to go to art museums a lot and just outdoors stuff
and my mom always insisted on walking for hours upon hours upon hours
so at this point it would be weird if i couldn't tolerate a lot of walking
omg my athletic ability is just missing
zoe walks more than i do in a day
lmao sam
i have 372 steps
ohhhhh
the last time i walked a bunch was august cause my friend and i were hanging out before they moved
oh wowwwww
i think the most i ever walked was around 18k steps sooo
oh wait nevermind i found a record from 2017
it was 26,272
hi ethannnnnnnnnn
my walking history is really weird to look at sometimes it's less than 100 and other times it's in the hundreds and other times it's in the thousands
oml sameeeeee zoe
not even thursday but thursday at 9pm ahahah
honestly i will not even worry about that lmaooo
^^^
gl lydiaaaaa
also good luck ethan
wait what time
ethan what time is yours?
you'll be in spis ethan
how could you sleep through that i-
lectures are at 8:45???
you know what works
siblings or parents
my mom sometimes will just pop in if i'm off schedule and sleeping too long
but also now that my brother is going to school there's so much noise in the morning
cause he stomps around the house
same but i'm skipping ahah
i'd rather do 16 units of stuff
good night ethan
i don't think i could really wreck my gpa that badly
honors sounds like stress
oh really? weird
i'm not even going to worry about my gpa
i have no plans on being an honors student
as long as i have a 3.0 i'm happy
i'm not expecting myself to really be just peachy
honestly i think the correct response is to kinda just let go of all the honor student stuff if it starts wrecking your mental health and stuff
honestly i think mental pain and trauma and stuff really comes back to haunt big time
which is why mental health matters!!!
that's good!!!!
that's great zoe!!!
jenny fr fr
;w;
s t i l l
ohhh i think i've heard of that before
ohhhh tendonitis is def scary
i hope you're taking better care of yourself now!!! :3
^^^^
;w;
pawsitivity :3
y'all we should go to bed
okay well we should all sleep
plus zoeee we can always hang out at ucsd
ahahah
t r u e
good night zoe & jenny!! :3
aww zoe that was cute!!!! :3
yeah it looks like their servers might be overloaded
the message appeared saying they're investigating
y'all i just realized that ucsd has cs in the name
letsgo (8) 
lmaooo
AGREED ! !!!
i liked seeing everyone :3
but it was pretty fun meeting the cog sci people
i've been doing my four year planning and one thing i've been doing besides the spreadsheet ucsd has is making a google doc checklist that i'm probably going to print out so if anyone else is really struggling to track grad reqs, would suggest that + checking degree audit
ALSO weird thing i noticed with mainly cog sci is that some prereqs are easy to miss because they don't separate the "ands" and "ors" which is trippy (like sometimes you can pick one class that fulfills a certain preq but there aren't clear distinctions on the course catalog whereas if you look at cse they put parentheses around each prereq and its other options if it has any) and it caused me to miss a few the first go although i feel like my sleep deprivation had a role in it too
lmfaoooooo
y'all is there a certain sound that reminds you of home that you're going to miss?
i'm going to miss the sound of my brother's aggressive and incessant clicking noises
‚ÄºÔ∏è 
he got this new gaming mouse that's apparently super light so his clicking is getting louder and more aggressive
i'm just really used to that sound ahahah
ooooh what are some mobile games y'all like playing?
oh those are pretty cool!!
i started identity v on a whim and a reccomendation
and it's hard
is it just me or is there no zoom link for niema's facets
like i don't see a hyperlink
idkkkk
okayyy
who else would knowww
^^
how's everyone's day going?
lmaooooo
also congrats zoe!!!!
@Cinnamon Bun i don't think your ticket went through
hmmm maybe go to lab lobby & ask???
you could ping one of the on duty mentors??
i have to wake up early to make a phone call, i love my existence (i am being veeeeery sarcastic rn)
‚ÄºÔ∏è 
all the classes i can take that don't cause conflicts with one another are waitlisted because they're all lower division since i have practically no ges left to take :3
math at night is walking a thin line ngl
same
you should zoe lmaooo
lowkey isn't there technically two for loops running?
i still look at that and think i'm looking at the war and peace version of what we were supposed to do lmao
ngl i cheated on mine and just used my school's naviance to make one back in high school, not that i ever had to use it lmao
y'all turns out i have junior standing at ucsd i-
i thought i had sophomore but i just called the registrar's office and was told i had junior level soooo it all worked out and i got rid of a waitlist course and replaced it with a upper division elective ahahah
oh fr?
that's niceeeeeeeeeee
i thought i was a sophomore cause i had 90 units but guess not lmfao
it is a relief though
it's nice to have an enrolled course ngl
right???
^^^^
what?
honestly i'm semi confused by the priority system (not the cse aspect but the other parts)
how important is standing?
ohhhhhh
so if i'm a freshman with junior standing does that do anything to my enrollment times or something
aside from the fact i can register for upper division courses that require a junior standing
actually
ohhhhhh
that's nice
this quarter is going to be interesting for me ig
i'm on waitlist for two cognitive science lower division courses
so if that doesn't work out
i'll be taking upper division elective courses that have space with my junior standing lmfao
yeah and it would mainly be the fault of my enrollment time lmfao
oml that would suck
then i'd go back to having practically nothing to do/take ahahah
lmaooo idk most of the students i know are junior standing freshmen
but from what i remember, a lot of y'all are sophomore standing freshmen, right?
the major minor area
it's open now so you can change majors and stuff
ohhhhhhh that's interestinggggggg
wait if i'm junior now
what's going to happen next year?
does that mean i'm a senior next year, that will be so weird
3 years of being a senior??? lmfao
right????
lmao i know
it would just be really funny and weird seeing senior for three years
i know the route i took isn't that popular ngl
mainly cause your social life gets really wrecked from it
yeah it's just really hard to do lmao
most of the time the schedules don't align plus you kinda get out of the loop w/ school activities if you don't try hard enough to keep up with them
yeah!!!
do any of y'all play identity v? i'm going to play that if anyone else wants to join myself and some of my friends from my guild lmao
it's a multiplayer game on mobile phones
the game is a lot like hide & seek except the seeker is dangerous
i think it might be???
so i googled it and yes it is like dead by daylight
hi zoeeeeeee :3
you could get a wheelchair?
yes stretches are importantttt
i think 45 units completed
cause there's a minimum of 180 and divide it by four and it's 45
i have 90 and i'm at junior
so i think it's right??
lmao mine is college credit ahah i only took 1 ap class ever
yep they do
i have 30.5 units in elective cred
you might wanna call the registrar if you're unsure
i called them and they told me my thingy
oh god those
i think i know what those are smh
i mean most college wifi networks can see what you're browsing to start??
oh that's quite interesting
i remember my high school used to force everyone to have this one browser extension so the teachers could see what tabs people had open
i know it's 11pm buuuut
how has everyone's day been? :3
oh that's niceee
me who just spent the last hour binging pro league players for no reason
how's aps going for y'all?
thank you @crossboy and @orangehachet 
i know i wasn't saying anything at all really but i got all of aps done so that was great !!! :3
it's eleven so before the day ends,
did y'all do anything fun today?
awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww that's cuteeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
‚ô•Ô∏è 
that's goood :3
after aps i had to do my game dailies, then i finished up some identity v stuff that i needed to do, and then i aggressively love bombed a bunch of people in my guild and i'm about to go back on identity v and fuel my addiction ;w;
üíú
as alex said earlier, what about everyone else who's on ???? :3
ohhh both of those sound fun!!!
congrats sam!!!!
awwwww that's niceeee
also happy birthdayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
üíõ 
i have yet to meet someone with the same month
much less the same birthday
it's been a long time since i met someone else born in january
like a few years
last time i met someone born in my month was like 2, almost 3 years ago
WAIT WHATTTTTTTTTt
yayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
zoeeeeeeeeeeeeee
i still remember being in school and the only person who was also celebrating their birthday in january was the kid who had the birthday in july and had to celebrate their half birthday at school instead lmao
i had a random late night thought: why do some games cause your phone to overheat?
ohhhhhhhhhhh
idv eats my battery within 3 rounds
maybe it's partially because of my giant friendlist
OMG JENNY
YAYYYYYYYYYY
january clubbbbb
6th
i got pulled into an idv match but i'm getting sleepy cause i took a melatonin
what about youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
ohhh niceeeeeeeeee
right?
we're still waiting for a match
5 minutes?
idk
i'm entering one rn
we'll see how fast it takes me to die
okay that round was exactly 5 minutes
but i usually play back to back rounds
and then if i'm teamed i feel bad ditching my teammate so i end up staying way too long
i usually only run have a few?
like three
idv is apparently just a big game to be running
not as bad as genshin or a webtoon game i used to play though
genshin made my phone burn up with just loading lmfao
lmaoooooooooo
i think it probably didn't help that i was playing a lot for the event as well
but it's fine cause i'm at home and i can always charge my phone :3
well i didn't delete it over that
there was a webtoon game that made my phone heat up within a minute of me playing for whatever reason and i kept it for a few weeks before i got bored
i quit genshin cause i died 20 times over one tiny mission
ahahah no i died on one of those beginner missions 20 times and just kinda went "y'know what...." and uninstalled
idv's tutorial wasn't hard, it was just painful ngl
there were 14 or 15 different parts to the whole thing, literal pain
but fr sometimes the tutorials are even more confusing than the actual game
i think the 15 parts was to kind of make sure everyone can actually play properly, which is fair because idv is kinda hard without tutorial handholding
ZOEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEee
i am semi-sleepy so if i disappear
it's melatonin
not yet
yayyyyyyyyyyyyyy
join usssssssssssssssss
i only recently learned that people can play idv on pc and i was so shook
identity v, it's like the mobile phone version of dead by daylight that's free and owned by a chinese company and semi-translated
and by semi-translated i mean sometimes you see the errant chinese characters in aspects of the game
all the characters also look like they're from coraline!!!
and i currently have 90 friends despite downloading the game only around 3 days or so ago
yeah!! most of them have button eyes
except the hunters who according to my brother, are the equivalent of dbd's killers
i never played dbd but my brother seems to think it's about the same as playing the mobile version of the game since ig the characters have a lot of crossover??
lmao
good morning alexxxxxxxxxxx :3
alexxxx that was soooo fun
you were amazinggggg
that was wickeddddd

@Jun Hwang
probably because a bunch of people are on there trying to check rn lmfao
i swear their servers get overloaded v often
i still remember when we were applying last fall and their servers ‚ú® died ‚ú®
three days out from the due date or something
my mom literally watched me turn it in like the first or second day of november or something like that
idk it was early when i got it in
lmfao i would have been part of the panic club if my mom wasn't giving me the laser eyes
omg our moms really saved us lmfao
pffffft not by choice, really
diego that sounds stressful
but hey, you're here now! and a mentor at that so you did just fine lmaooooooooooooooooo
perhaps your true hidden talent is typing really fast with your thumbs üëÄ
ALSO JENNY I JUST SAW YOU IN THE COGSCI SERVE CAUSE I RANDOMLY CLICKED ON IT
yeah fr

lmfao
sam you should add that to the quotes
