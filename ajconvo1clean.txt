tnr just reminds me of school and mla:(
i honestly find essays and english the easiest of all classes\ni used to love timed essays
i did that too on my old school account but thatâ€™s deleted now agh i shouldâ€™ve changed it
and i think my teacher hated me for loving timed essays
i donâ€™t agree with you uhhh do you wanna take mmw for me LMAO
well he didn't actually hate me\ni was one of his favorite students\nbut i would write a ton of pages of stuff\nit was usually pretty thick when i was finally done
ok i used to like them bc my take home essays were basically timed because i would procrastinate soo much and theyâ€™d be the same quality
yeahh\nimagine how the person grading my whap test felt\nthey probably felt like they got slapped with a giant tidal wave of words
maybe they saw the stack and just gave it a good grade :D\nreminds me of how ppl would say to just ramble on act essay and youâ€™d do well
i'm just really quick to make things up\noml that act essay is so easy\nso was the sat essay\nexcept that one time where i got a low score for arguing against the prompt\nbut we don't talk about that
i did better on the act one for both parts lol\nsad moment when i remmeber that they did nothing for my admissions\nLOL
i thought the essay was the easiest part of the standardized test\ni was so bad with math\ni really got a 27 on math\neven though i did calc ab
i definitely didnâ€™t like the essay\nripp sometimes itâ€™s easier without the higher level knowledge tho because i think it only went to geo or alg
honestly that is so fair\nngl i did terrible in precalc/trig as in i understood almost nothing\nand i still did just fine in calculus ab\ni left with an a
reminds me of how i tried tot tutor a 6th grader in a class i never took bc i skipped it... they were learning smth SO USELESS i didnâ€™t know how to do it aidkskckdkcd
then a semester later i had to drop calc bc because it was like gibberish to me
hmm i did rly well in precalc but bc was much more difficult but i did well bc the ap test was online and there wasnâ€™t mcq lmao
i was lucky my professor took out the part of the final on integrals since everyone bombed that part
PRE CALC
ahahah
my phone hates me\ni forgot how it even works
i only like derivatives\nand my stats class was wayyyyyy better
derivatives are easier and you donâ€™t have to +c it
i just got to use my calculator and not show most of my work
lol stats annoyed me there was too much writing
i literally took ab and bc back to back in semesters and still forgot integrals\nso now i have to retake bc cause i dropped it
its okay you can take fewer courses whenever you have to take calc b (if you want to)!\nyou probably will have to do calc c as well but it's not as bad as calc b imo
lmao i have most of my ges done so i can't put it off much longer to begin with lmaoooo
as of now i only need linear algebra but if i try to change something about my path then i might need to do 20c whatever that is and i donâ€™t wanna have to relearn
oh that is going to be fun in the most painful way possible
doing multidimensional derivatives sounds terrible but it's not actually that bad
for cogsci it isnâ€™t required *i think*
it's literally just do the derivative twice\nand that's pretty much the whole class\n"do this thing you alreayd know how to do, but do it twice instead"
that is actually kinda nice
yah its definitely not as hard of a jump as b is lolol
b is not a jump\nit's a shove off a cliff
it doesnâ€™t sound too bad now but idk you might just be very smart lolll\ni donâ€™t even know if calc bc also teaches a? never understood the system
it's fine though, i think my current existing college gpa can carry me even if i mess up two math classes
ya plus you might be able to take some stuff p/np as well (can't remember if math is able to be) so that's always an option
whenever i see p/np i think of that millenium problem
which problem?
it's one of those very difficult to solve math problems that has like a huge reward if you can get the correct solution
OH THAT P/NP
i want to say that one of them did get solved but i also might have remembered wrong
yeah it's a huge problem in math/cs, it might get covered in spis a bit but im not sure
i know they mentioned p/np but not the actual problem itself\ni was watching gifted and the millenium problems came up\nalong with the trachtenberg method i think\ni remember uselessly large words and then when i need to use them my brain goes b l a n k
sounds like another last name
trachtenberg is a last name
my brain forgets sooo many words it makes me so annoyed during timed essays because i canâ€™t think about what that random common word is
i am usually that one student who is technically done but keeps writing anyway
yeah all these equations  and methods named after people just confuse me\ncould never relate\ni usually have half my paper written and itâ€™s just unfinished
i know i have a large vocabulary\ni just never use it\nand i really like learning those random words from tumblr that are so rarely used\nand then i don't use them
i love that\ni think i used to do that
the only time those tumblr words ever come into use is when yet another person titles a fanfic using one of those
like defenestrate\niâ€™m surprised i actually remembered one of the strange words i learned
i learned words like gracile\nwhich i never use\nand then i randomly apply chemistry terminology to real life\ndespite sleeping through my chemistry honors class during my second semester
doesnâ€™t even sound english tbh
i still don't know how i got an a in that class
lolll i like randomly throwing in chem bc that class actually interested me
and my chem 1a was carried by huge extra credit\ni overuse state function\nnot in the literal sense\nbut i just use it to mean like the process isn't important, just the destination\ni think i've also equated people to the different elemental groups before
oh lmaoo i was thinking boit it\nwow
and people always look at me funny for it
i would probably tbh LOL
not that i find it important how they feel lmfao
you just seem like a metalloid today
i'll just be like "noble gas personality type" out of the blue\nor i'll say someone's like a halogen
oh wait groups not properties see i forogt most my chem oops\nwait i could see the noble gas tho
i think the weirdest thing i've ever done was try to convert all my writing into old english runes
maybe even alkaline earth itâ€™s strange\noh i really canâ€™t deal w old english
old english and old english runes are different\nthe runes looked a lot like dwarvish from lotr\nand i thought they were pretty
OH
yeah
i just searched it ok
i mean before that i wanted to write mirror script but being left handed, i technically could have done that to start
gives me hieroglyph vibes
yeah it really does\nthere's also elvish which is pretty\ni also at one point wanted to be ambidextrous
have you practiced mirror script at all?
so i can kinda write with my right hand
oo elvish looks mystical
i mean i usually don't but i can do it alright
ahahah i used to practice my left
i can read mirrored text just fine\ni can technically draw with my right hand using a mouse
but not with a pencil
there were a few stages where i literally would use my left in school but then i started to need to write fast and that didnâ€™t work
not that well\nahahah when i write fast i end up with print-cursive
iâ€™ve never tried because i just canâ€™t draw at all with anything LOL
the only thing i can consistently draw are cats\nand sometimes bears
my handwriting is pretty bad it looks scribbly because i end up connecting everythibg\ni need to learn how to draw cute animals
i learned cursive and now i mix my print and cursive
like just stick figure version
it looks confusing as heck though reading my notes\nusually when i write words that end in ing, the i disappears\nit just leaves
i guess some of my writing is cursive because of how it connects but i usually donâ€™t write things like the cursive s anymore
i also don't dot my i's anymore sooooooooo\nmy i's and e's look similar
i havenâ€™t written in so long i canâ€™t remmeber how i write\nmany times when i write my names i donâ€™t write 2 nâ€™s properly
ahahahah i write things down by hand
i just have some lumpy scribbled
i tend to forget otherwise
cause if i type i sometimes i forget to check where i left whatever i wrote down
ah i like typing bc iâ€™ll forget anyways LOL
honestly i just realized\ni'm kinda like a function
oh i guess sometimes it doesnâ€™t motivate me to read notes as much but\nhmm
i just take in input, create an output\nand then i forget everything again
LOL
it actually explains why i have no clue what i've turned in for the most part\nespecially my essays, thank goodness no one asks me to explain those
Wonâ€™t comment on that bc i donâ€™t wanna say some strange incorrect code thing in a cs server ðŸ˜©
ahahah i made my brother so frustrated\nhe was trying to help me check my code and then he was like wth
o m g do you just turn in assignments or tests and completely forget the topic or prompt
oh i don't even really remember the prompt after i write it
i tried to ask my sis but i forgot she knows nothing ðŸ˜­
ahahah
ikr people ask what i wrote about and iâ€™m like ... what did we even do
i literally just try to think of the easiest way to solve the problem so i can write almost zero code\ni mean i just make something up, if i get a hint of what i should say, i can usually make something up.\nguess the theatre classes i took panned out years ago
i wanna write less but my brain doenst process til after i do smth rly convoluted lmao
ahhhhhh same\ni usually say something and then i end up overexplaining myself
oo theater fun fun those classes scare me tho
they give me so much anxiety\nbut i also did them ig
thatâ€™s me 50% of the time if i do speak iâ€™ll overspeak
technically i guess i can act, i'm good with expressions
but a lot of times i just donâ€™t speak at all lol
ahahah when we had to do closing circle i really wrote out what i was going to say i still panicked anyway ahahah
oo i just know i did one acting thing as a child and i laugh sm when i watch now and wonder what the heck happened to me
i used to do musicals so theoretically i should be okay with like idk stages?\nbut i'm not
oh i didnâ€™t get to go today :( how was it? forogt to ask someone about it
it took a long time and everyone just kinda thanked other people
i used to have the worst stage fright (probably still do)
and i just read whatever i wrote while panicking oh i have stage fright too
aw thatâ€™s nice i would probably not wanna speak up tho lmao
the deer in the headlights oh it was mandatory for everyone
oh well\nguess iâ€™ll experience it next week=\najejdkskckdkck
i swear things were easier when we were kids like being on stage and stuff i don't know how i did it then
everything was easier then
it really wassss
i really wanna channel my younger energy but i cannot comprehend
honestly i was thinking back to the musicals i did and i just realized how weirdly sexist my fair lady was like there's this whole song when the english professor rants about women
i donâ€™t rly know musicals well but i guess many were made back in the day where it was normal to be misogynistic
trueeeee honestly i got into musicals because of my parents
i think a few years ago i wanted to try to do a musical but obviously my stage fright completely killed that
awwwwwwwwwwwwwwww\ni think the first musical i saw was les mis or phantom i didn't understand the lovely ladies thing until like years later
oo do your parents watch a lot
no not really
my first (and only i think) was phantom
my dad just had them and i was introduced to them early although i watched ghibli films long before that
ah makes sense oh those are all cute throwbacks now
i think the last muscial i saw was carrie
oh wait i saw hamilton last year but it was from home so idk if that counts lol
ohhh hamilton is fun\ni don't remember if i did but i was looking forward to the in the heights film
i just know it was free on disney + for a bit and my sister had my friends account lmao
did you ever have a gymnastics phase?
omg i did gymnastics in prek i think lmao
ahahah sameeeeeeeeeee\nand then i stopped\nbut i really wanted to do a handstand, so i taught myself
started dance around that time tho and that was what i stuck with but i did have a few phases throughout where i wanted to do gymnastics things
i swear everyone did back in those days\nahahah
oh sound of music has nice songs at least the ones i know lol tho i still canâ€™t handstand iâ€™m WEAK
i did ballet i think idk i don''t remember i can still do it, but it's best when you're in a pool soo much easier
i did ballet til 7th i think then technically did it in hs but not rly oh iâ€™ve never tried in a pool i donâ€™t like water tbh i canâ€™t even breathe easily when iâ€™m standing in a pool lolll
ohhh that actually makes sense you could also do it against a wall
i can see how handstand would be easier but like id prob choke on water LOL i used to do that but my arms would give out too soon hehe
i honestly went through trial and error to do it but i also did basketball as a sport soooooooooo
i guess i didnâ€™t care much about handstands bc i wanted to be flexible and do tricks more lmao oh sports not my thing but tbh basketball was an ok unit in pe loll
i can't say if sports were really my thing
tho iâ€™ve barely scored any baskets in my life
i just did them i was only good at guarding
dance was my only athletic thing ever til that one year of track ew yeah i canâ€™t do that either but ehhh whatwver LOL
i just didn't like doing offensive stuff
not gonna play bball in the future or anything
honestly if i actually focused on cross country, my stamina would probably be better smh i think by the end of the season was when my stamina was just beginning to get good and then the season ended ahahahah
but thatâ€™s the hard part :â€™) idk how people have the motivation i wish i could
i don't even know how i convinced myself to run 2 miles
once an xc friend tricked me into running 3 MILES i thought i was gonna die
and the worst part was i had a friend who was shouting at me to run faster ahahah
1 is my max bc itâ€™s required in pe smh
honestly 1 mile is so nice
oh no that pressure when youâ€™re alrd dying trying to pace yourself
pfft i would actually slow down just to spite him ahahah
i disagree 1 lap is more than enough LOL i did sprints in t&f bc i wanted to hurdle
oml the 400 m as a track event is so hardddddddddd
AGREED
i still remember doing training
i literally never did it before but my first meet, they signed everyone up for the 400
i'd have to do those weird things where you sprint 50 m and walk 50 m or something and go up by increments of 50 or something
i basically died
i ran a 3200 once
ohh yeah i think we did that
it was horrid
ewww disgusting n
i did pretty good in 400 and then i quit
after the first meet i never did the 409 again even tho i was supposed to lmao i did horrendous in literally everything but jumps and hurdles
honestly lining up gives me anxiety i just get all freaked out being in line and stuff
WHCIH WERE THE REASON I WANTD TO JOIN but didnâ€™t think iâ€™d need to just run for 95% of practice and the gun scared me lol i have slow reflexes too
oh yeah, track definitely is like RUN RUN RUN
i joined with friends who also just wanted to do jumping events but they quit i forgot why
i used to just watch people get smoked
and i was left there not realizing jumping is for sprinters who only run during practice and have to stay extra to do other stuff lmao
like one of the soccer players was in track and he would outsprint practically everyone in the 100m
ok but itâ€™s sometimes interesting to wat h fast ppl
i find it hilarious also perhaps we should sleep
like i could never dream of moving at that speed it looks so strange
ahahah
oh uhhh
like it's almost 4 am
itâ€™s been an hr since i pointed out the time????
yes time flies
ok yeah letâ€™s sleep
because it's fun
i wonder if anyone is gonna even try to scroll and read tmrw LOL
but i also need to zip it and sleep before i wake up tomorrow and bask in my regret like i did this morning
i say that like it isn't already the next day
theyâ€™ll learn a lot about us without us knowing!!
it's fine
oh yes i regret my choices a little bit every morning but not enough to change my habits
because i'll probably start another long convo tomorrow :3
yay funn
ahahahahahah y e s and we can hang out more
i donâ€™t think iâ€™ll get back til late so hopefully the chat goes crazy lmao mhm mhm :)
i also have stuff to do tomorrow like looking at my classes i need for graduating in a few years lmao
oh i tried to do that before but i wonâ€™t think about that rn lmaoo GOOD NOGHT!
good nightttttttttttttt
